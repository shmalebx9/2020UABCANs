# Reading Notes Torts

Rule in Rylands v Fletcher, someone is liable when they are

+  In control of or responsible for
+  Something that could cause damage 
+  in a non-natural use of the land

This does not require any fault.

The test for non-natural use is

+  use that introduces special danger
+  use that is unusual  for that land
+ is of no general benefit to the community

# Strict Liability

It is not always known if a person should be considered an "employee" or subordinate of the tortfeasor in a case. The court thus considers several factors to establish a relationship that could indicate strict liability

Strict liability tests

+ Control: did the tortfeasor have control over the person who committed the tort
+ Organization/integration test: is the person who committed the tort an integral part of the tortfeasor's organization.

Other factors considered in strict liability

+ Ownership of tools used 
+ Chance of profits
+ Risk of loss 

Once it is determined that the person who committed a tort is an employee of the tortfeasor, the court must determine whether the court was committed in the course of employment.

Tests for course of employment

+ Acts expressly authorized or condoned by the employer.
	+ This only proves the positive. 
+ Salmond test: Unauthorized mode (method) of doing something authorized by the employer. Ex: a mail deliver-person leaves a package where it is a trip hazard.


## Morris v C.W. Martin & sons Ltd. (1966, ECA)

Morrissey, Martin's employee was directed (authorized) to clean morris's mink stole. He jacked the stole instead. Martin is liable because the theft occurred in the authorization to clean.

## BLACKWATER V PLINT 2005 SCC 58, [2005] 3 SCR 3

**Facts:** Barney Blackwater was a student at a Presbyterian-run residential school. Barney was sexually assaulted regularly by Plint. Plint was an employee at the school who supervised the dorms. Plint lived with the children at the school. Barney notified other school staff on multiple occasions of the abuse and was physically reprimanded and told to cease making claims of abuse. The school was hired by the government of Canada to run the school. The Canadian government provided most of the budget but the school handled hiring and firing staff. The trial judge apportioned 75% of the blame to Canada, 25% to the church. The BC court of appeal partially reversed the decision.

**Issue:** Is the church or Canada liable for negligence? Are any strictly liable? If so, how should the "fault" be apportioned.

**Rule:** Totrts must be specific. Government policy itself does not suffice as cause for a tort.  For the tort of negligence, the tortfeasor must have failed to prevent a foreseeable harm. For strict liability, the tortfeasor need only be responsible for the person who committed the tort in service of the tortfeasor.

**Analysis:** The supreme court largely overruled the BCCA and sided with the reasoning of the trial judge. The supreme court did not find any cause for the tort of negligence. In the view of the court: sexually assault in a religious school was unthinkable at the time. Neither Canada nor the church could be liable for failing to present something not foreseeable. Additionally, when the church did hear of sexaul abuse they immediately fired the employee responsible. The supreme court upheld the trial judge's reasoning in relation to assigning liability. The court rejected the BCCA's contention that a person (Plint) could not have two employers for the sake of strict liability. The court considered the factors for strict liability from blazey:

+ (a) the opportunity afforded by the employer’s enterprise for the employee to abuse his power
	+ Found for the plaintiff
+ (b) the extent to which the wrongful act furthered the employer’s interests
	+ In favour of tortfeasor
+ (c) the extent to which the employment situation created intimacy or other conditions conducive to the wrongful act
	+ In favour of plaintiff
+ (d) the extent of power conferred on the employee in relation to the victim
	+ In favour of plaintiff
+ (e) the vulnerability of potential victims.
	+ mixed

Assigning more blame to Canada was also upheld since it was the "senior partner." Barney also claimed that Canada and the church should be liable for breach of fiduciary responsibility. The court ultimately rejected the claim but defined two views of fiduciary responsibility:

+ Collective View: was not brought up as an issue in the lower courts and therefore cannot be ruled on
+ Individual View (standard): The school had no fiduciary responsibility to Barney.

**Conclusion:** Decision of BCCA largely reversed. Canada is 75% liable and the church 25%. Only the sexual assault tort via strict liability succeeded.

## 65EB V ORDER OF THE OBLATES OF MARY IMMACULATE IN THE PROVINCE OF BRITISH COLUMBIA 2005 SCC 60, [2005] 3 SCR 45

**Facts:** The appellant attended a residential school for First Nations children run by the respondent Order of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate in the Province of British Col-umbia (“Oblates”) on Meares Island, British Columbia. He suffered sexual abuse at the hands of a lay employee, Martin Saxey, also of First Nations origin, who worked in the school bakery and operated the school motorboat. The appellant never notified the school of the abuse while it was going on. The appellant sought damages from the oblates.

**Issue:** Can a residential school be held strictly liable when the employees conduct took place outside the performance of his duties?

**Rule:** The five blazey factors.

**Analysis:** The court examined all relevant factors as follows:

+ Opportunity: The oblates kept the lay staff in separate living quarters and made sure to send a brother to accompany Saxey when he operated his boat. Saxey used candy to lure appellant away from the area the children were allowed to be in. The Oblates therefore did not provide Saxey the opportunity.
+ Furtherance of interest: Obviously, the abuse did not further the Oblates' interests.
+ Intimacy created by the employment: Saxey's job did not require significant interaction with the children and definitely not intimacy as a caregiver or otherwise.
+ Power given over victims: The school did allow the children to preform chores for Saxey on occasion but the court did not find this power significant.
+ Vulnerability of potential victim: The children in residential schools were especially vulnerable. This part of the test was not satisfied however, since the vulnerability was a result of the institution of residential schools, not the policy of the Oblates.

The court therefore did not find that there was a "strong connection" between Saxey's employment and the abuse.

>the notion of fairness to the not-for-profit organization remains compatible with vicarious liability, provided that a strong connection is established between the job-conferred authority and the sexual assault. As the analysis above demonstrates, however, the strong connection test cannot be met in this case, given Saxey’s limited role at Christie [the school].

**Conclusion:** The Oblates were not found liable for the assaults.


# Defamation

## Defamation Act, RSA 2000, c D-7

> 1(b) “defamation” means libel or slander;
> 2(2) When defamation is proved, damage shall be presumed.
> 4 A plaintiff may admit into evidence the fact that they made a written apology as mitigating evidence as long as it was given to the plaintiff prior to the commencement of proceedings.
> 9(2) Notwithstanding subsection (1), the defence of fair comment is not available to a defendant if it is proved that the defendant acted maliciously in making the publication.
> 13(1)  No action lies unless the plaintiff has, within 3 months after the publication of the defamatory matter has come to the plaintiff’s notice or knowledge, given to the defendant, in the case of a daily newspaper, 7, and in the case of any other newspaper or when the defamatory matter was broadcast, 14 days’ notice in writing of the plaintiff’s intention to bring an action, specifying the defamatory matter complained of.

Defences:

+ Good faith
+ Published in public interest
+ Published retraction

## Awanv. Levant, 2014ONSC

**Facts:** In his conservative blog about Canadian hate speech law, Ezra Levant labeled law student Khurrum Awan a “liar” and an “illiberal Islamic fascist” seeking to destroy Canada’s freedom of expression. The two had a back-and-fourth exchange of blog posts. Levant's blog posts contained errors of fact, some of which were later retracted prior to the commencement of proceedings.

**Issue:** Whether Levant's blog posts calling Awan a "liar" rise to the level of defamation.

**Rule:** The test for defamation is whether the statement:

+ Is defamatory: causes a reasonable person to have a negative view of the person defamed.
+ Refers to the plaintiff: Can be implicit or explicit
+ Was actually published

**Analysis:** The court found that Levant's statement in the blog posts met all the test for defamation. Calling someone a "liar" causes a reasonable person to have a lower opinion of that person. The defence argued that a reasonable person who reads Levant's work would know he was an outlandish character and take his words with a grain of salt. The court was not convinced and instead chose to rely on a more objective test rather than evaluate the way knowledgeable reader of Levant would interpret his words. The court also found evidence of malice in the blog posts themselves and in Levant's decision to perform minimal fact checking.

**Conclusion:** Levant was ordered to pay $80,000 to Awan.

## WIC RadioLtd.v. Simpson, 2008 SCC40

**Facts:** Rafe Mair, a liberal Vancouver radio host, discussed the political activities of Kari Simpson. Kari Simpson was a conservative who opposed gay marriage and inclusion of homosexuality in school curricula. In voicing his opinion of Simpson, Mair compared her to the KKK and other hate groups.

**Issue:** Whether a comment about a public person can be considered defamatory.

**Rule:** The court developed a new test for whether the "fair comment" test applies in a defamation case:

+ The comment must be on a matter of public interest
+ The comment must based on fact
+ The comment must be recognizeable as a comment
+ The comment must be one that a person (not necessarily reasonable) could honestly express

**Analysis:** The court applied the test and concluded that Mair was not liable for defamation. The court noted that the defence could be defeated if the plaintiff proved malice. In this case the plaintiff did not prove malice.

**Conclusion:** Mair is not liable for damages.

## Standard of Care

**The objective standard:** The standard by which negligence is measured. The objective standard depends on the objective legal principles around the circumstances. The objective standard can be defined as *that which a reasonable person would do in the circumstances.* Importantly, the standard does not depend on the particularities of the defendant or their beliefs.

**Exception to Objective standard:** There is an exception for mental or physically disability. This requires only proving that the defendant was in some way impaired, not totally **incapable.**

## Vaughn v Menlove (1837), 132 ER 490 (CP)

**Facts:** Vaughn stacked hay bails thick and high. This practice is discouraged as it can lead to fires. The plaintiff told V that he should properly store his hay but V said he would "chance it." The hay started a fire which burned down M's cottages. M sued for damages. V claims his lack of intelligence as a defence against negligence. Specifically, the defence argued that the trial judge erred in charging the jury to consider whether V was guilty by the standard of of "ordinary prudence." The defence wanted V to be judged based on whether he had acted to the best of his judgment.

**Issue:** Whether a person's unique characteristics, such as intelligence, impact the legal standard of care by which they should be judged.

**Rule:** A person is always judged by the objective standard (with few exceptions). There is no other objective standard.

**Analysis:** A standard which includes reference to the defendant cannot be used. If it were, the law would be far too ambiguous and subjective. In order to have any rule at all, the rule must not reference the defendant.

**Conclusion:** The objective standard is based on the reasonable person, not on the defendant. Appeal dismissed.

## Buckley v Smith Transport Limited, [1946] OR 798 (CA)

**In brief:** This case diverges from the formalism of *Menlove.* Buckley hit the defendant's street car while speeding. Buckley had syphilis which caused insanity, he died one month after the accident. His defence argued successfully that he was not liable because he was insane. The test for insanity is whether the defendant's delusion:

+ Made the defendant unable to understand their duty of care. **AND**
+ Made the defendant unable to fulfill their duty of care.

## Roberts v Ramsbottom, [1980] 1 All ER 7 (QBD)

**In brief:** This case is similar to the one above. A man ran into a van and then a parked car. He had a stroke at the time which caused the accident. The judge found that the defendant was clearly not morally to blame but he was in fact liable to pay. Only incapacitation can suffice as a defence, not a simple impairment. Since the defendant was technically in conscious sane control of his vehicle, he is liable.

## Mansfield v Weetabix, [1998] 1 WLR 1263 (CA)

**In brief:** The court overruled the reasoning of *Roberts* in this case. A trucker, Tarleton, did not know that he had a condition which impaired his brain function when his blood-sugar was low. He caused an accident after not eating. The court found Tarleton non-liable. A reasonable driver who did not know of their condition would not have done anything different than Tarleton, therefore he fulfilled his duty of care.

## McHale v Watson (1966), 115 CLR 199 (Aust HC)

**Facts:** Barry Watson, 12, was playing by the ocean in Australia. He found a small metal rod and sharpened it to use as an opening tool for shellfish. Susan McHale, 10, and some other children then offered to play tag with Barry. After the game of tag finished Barry threw the small metal rod at a wooden post. Barry intended to have the rod stick to the post as would a throwing knife. The rod bounced off the post and destroyed McHale's right eye. McHale sued for negligence. At trial, the judge considered Barry's age and therefore dismissed the claim. 

**Issue:** Did the trial judge err in considering the age of the defendant? Can age factor into the "reasonable person" in the objective standard?

**Rule:** The objective standard must be objective. The objective standard is by definition reasonable.

**Analysis:** Age is not a factor that "breaks" objectivity. The actions of a reasonable person will objectively differ based on age. Additionally, fixing on any age for the "reasonable person" would be arbitrary. By the standards of a reasonable 12 year old boy, Barry was not negligent.

**Conclusion:** Appeal dismissed. Barry was not negligent because his action was reasonable for a young boy.

**Dissent:** Menzies J (dissenting) argued that Barry was liable. The law states that the objective standard is that of a reasonable "man." The term "man" sets the age somewhere in adulthood.

## McErlean v Sarel (1987), 61 OR (2d) 396 at 412-14 (CA)

**Facts:** McErlean and Sarel were both young men riding motorized trail bikes on an unofficial trail. The two youth approached a bend at high speeds in opposite directions. Sarel, 15, was on the wrong side of the trail when he hit and injured McErlean. 

**Issue:** By what age should Sarel's negligence, 15, be judged?

**Rule:** There is an objective standard. There is a clear exception for children. The court created an exception the childhood exception.

**Analysis:** There must be one clear standard of care for certain dangerous "adult" activities. Operating a motorized vehicle is one such dangerous and "adult" activity. The standard for dangerous activities is that of a reasonable adult.

**Conclusion:** Sarel should be judged as an adult.

>"When the rights of adulthood are granted, the responsibilities of maturity should also accompany them"

## The Learned Hand

Posner related the learned hand principle as follows: 

+ if the probability be called P
+ the injury, L
+ the burden, B
+ Then liability depends upon whether B is less than L multiplied by P: i.e., whether B < PL

Expected cost is most easily understood as the average cost that will be incurred over a period of time long enough for the predicted number of accidents to be the actual number. If the expected cost is higher than the cost of preventing the injury then firms will opt to prevent it. The current tort system enforces this economic principle. This means that the maximal economic benefit is enjoyed by society.

Posner then relates this to the "orthodox view." The orthodox view holds that originally, tort law was based mainly on strict liability. In the nineteenth century, the courts moved towards a fault-based system. This new system had its goal as the maximization of industrial development. By shifting to a fault system, the courts thereby gave a subsidy to businesses which endangered others (workers or the public). The new system is criticized on the basis that it unduly benefits business when the subsidy is no longer needed.

Posner argues that the current system actually benefits society as a whole. The maximal benefit is given to society when the costs of accident avoidance is incurred only when it is economical practical. Additionally, the new system accounts for the moral outrage at tort cases where the tortfeasor is at fault but not when the opposite is true.

Bender counters by arguing from a feminist perspective. She argues that the cost of injury should not be explained in economic terms. Rather, society should encourage injury-avoidance for its own sake.

>"instead of measuring carefulness or caution, we measured concern and responsibility for the well-being of others and their protection from harm? Negligence law could begin with Gilligan’s articulation of the feminine voice’s ethic of care—a premise that no one should be hurt"

Posner replied to this criticism by arguing that the feminist perspective may not be as "feminist" as it seems. Posner explained that human nature is to care deeply for those to whom one has a real duty (family and friends) and much less so for strangers. Posner then points out that strict liability does not simply shift costs to tortfeasors and benefits to the injured. Rather, strict liability shifts costs to society as a whole through higher prices on goods and services as firms spend more to avoid harm. Posner then retorts that strict liability can be seen as more "masculine" than a fault system:

>"Bender associates altruism with women. On the other hand, strict liability is more rule-like, less standard-like, less contextualist, less sensitive to the particulars of the individual accident"

## Bolton v Stone [1951] AC 850 (HL)

**Facts:** The respondent was standing on a quiet street near the appellant's cricket field. A ball flew outside the field onto the side street, causing serious injury to the respondent. The appellant knew of the possibility of projectiles straying onto the street. Balls had, on rare occasions, strayed in the same way before but without causing injury. At trial, the respondent argued that the appellant was negligent because he **knew of the risk** and **did nothing to prevent it.** 

**Issue:** What level of risk necessitates that someone takes care to prevent risk? Is it **possibility** or some level of **likelihood.**

**Rule:** The objective standard is that of a reasonable person (*man*). A reasonable person would not take steps to prevent an extremely unlikely outcome.

**Analysis:** A stray ball flew into the street very rarely (around once every three seasons). The road itself was not busy. It stands to reason that the possibility of a stray ball entering the street at the same time as a person was so situated to be hit was exceedingly small. The injury suffered by the respondents was therefore **foreseeable** but not likely. The court rejected the respondent's claim that once a ball strayed into the road the appellant should have taken steps to prevent it happening again. The court reasoned that a reasonable person does not take (presumably costly) steps to prevent an unlikely outcome. Accordingly, the objective standard of care was not breached.

**Conclusion:** The objective standard should mean that a person is liable for failing to prevent only a reasonably likely injury. Appeal allowed.

## Notes on *Bolton*

Prior to *Bolton,* possible outcomes in a tort case were considered as either:

+ An outcome that would have been regarded as unreal prior to its occurrence
+ An outcome where there was a real and substantial risk that the outcome would occur

These two options forced judges to cram highly unlikely outcomes into the category of outcomes for which a reasonable person would be expected to take measures to avoid. Obviously, this binary system is incorrect. A reasonable person would not take precautions to avoid extremely unlikely outcomes even if they were "possible" or "real."

Bolton left open the question of what level of expense could be justified by a possible or unlikely outcome. In Latimer v AEC, a factory was flooded and became slippery. The employer spread sawdust on the floor and took other measures to prevent slips. A slip causing injury happened anyway. The injured employee argued that since slipping was a possibility, the plant should have been shut down until the floor could be cleaned. The court rejected that claim. Though the measures taken indicated a knowledge of a substantial risk, this could not justify the closure of the plant. The court held that a reasonable person would conduct an implicit economic analysis similar to that explained by Posner. A reasonable factory owner would then conclude that the cost of closing the plant outweighed the cost of a potential slip.

## The Queen (Can) V Saskatchewan Wheat Pool [1983] 1 SCR 205, 143 DLR (3d) 9

**Facts:** The Canadian Wheat Board (the Board) sought seeking to recover damages from the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool (the Pool). The wheat board purchased a large shipment of wheat from the pool. The delivery was tested for beetle infestation before being loaded onto a ship. A sample was then sent to further analysis while the ship was loaded and left harbour. Before the delivery could be made, the lab found a rusty beetle infestation in the sample. The ship had to be docked and fumigated and all of the wheat was worthless. By statute, the pool could not sell infested grain (absolute liability). The Board sought to use the statutory breach as the basis for a tort.

**Issue:** Where A has breached a statutory duty causing injury to B does B have a civil cause of action against A? If so, is A's liability absolute, in the sense that it exists independently of fault, or is A free from liability if the failure to perform the duty is through no fault of their own?

**Rule:** 

1. Civil consequences of breach of statute should be subsumed in the law of negligence. Such that a negligent breach of a statutory duty will be a basis for the tort of negligence.
2. There is no nominate tort of statutory breach.

**Analysis:** In England, the House of Lords affirmed the existence of a tort of statutory breach distinct from any issue of negligence. In the United States, courts **may** use statutes to infer a reasonable standard of care in a negligence case. With this as a foundation, the court considered the motivations for each view. Firstly, it may be said that a reasonable person does not break the law, and therefore a statutory breach is *per se* negligent. On the other hand, absolute liability offences are created with entirely different aims than civil causes of action. Torts require fault, and to link a tort to an absolute liability statutory offence would remove the fault element. Statutory breaches may still reasonably be used by judges to inform the objective standard.

**Conclusion:** Action failed. There is no tort of statutory breach. The court summarized:

> 1. Civil consequences of breach of statute should be subsumed in the law of negligence.
> 2. The notion of a nominate tort of statutory breach giving a right to recovery merely on proof of breach and damages should be rejected, as should the view that unexcused breach constitutes negligence per se giving rise to absolute liability.
> 3. Proof of statutory breach, causative of damages, may be evidence of negligence.
> 4. The statutory formulation of the duty may afford a specific, and useful, standard of reasonable conduct.
> 5. In the case at Bar negligence is neither pleaded nor proven. The action must fail.

## Ryan v Victoria (City), [1999] 1 SCR 201

**In brief:** The plaintiff had the wheel of his motorcycle caught in the gaps of a rail track on a public road. The plaintiff was thrown from his vehicle and suffered injury. The gaps in the road where within the statutory requirement. The court found that the principle in *Saskatchewan Wheat Pool* applies in the reverse. Compliance with statutory requirements does not *necessarily* discharge one's duty of care.

## Seneca College v Bhadauria [1981] 2 SCR 181, 124 DLR (3d) 193

**Facts:** The plaintiff (B) was a highly qualified doctor of mathematics. B sent multiple applications to the defendant (college) in response to advertisements for employment. B was passed over in favour of less qualified applicants on multiple occasions. B inferred that her applications were denied on the basis of her (identifiable) Indian origin. The Ontario Human Rights Commission had the ability to investigate claims of discrimination claims and enforce remedies. B sought instead to initiate a civil action for discrimination. The trial judge dismissed the claim as there is no tort of discrimination. The Ontario court of appeal held that B need only prove that she had a right which the college violated in order to proceed. 

**Issue:** Whether there is a tort of discrimination. Whether a regulatory regime can be used to ground a civil claim.

**Rule:** The Ontario Court Created the new tort for this case. There was no such tort prior to this. 
The courts should shy away from creating new obligations by judicial fiat.

**Analysis:** The HRC is relied on as grounding the civil claim. The HRC already provides remedies for the offences it creates. It would be in one sense duplicative to create a civil action. In another sense, it actually goes further in creating a new responsibility to confer an economic benefit onto someone to whom the tortfeasor has no special duty of care. Basically, the court reasoned that the policy considerations behind the tort system and regulatory regime were not compatible.

>"For the foregoing reasons, I would hold that not only does the Code foreclose any civil action based directly upon a breach thereof but it also excludes any common law action based on an invocation of the public policy expressed in the Code. The Code itself has laid out the procedures for vindication of that public policy, procedures which the plaintiff did not see fit to use."

**Conclusion:** Appeal allowed. Trial judgment restored.
