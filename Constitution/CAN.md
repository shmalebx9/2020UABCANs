## Constitutional Principles, Interpretation, and Architecture

**At a glance:** The constitution is the supreme law of Canada; any law incompatible with the constitution is of no force or effect. There are several legitimate sources of constitutional authority in Canada:

+ Indigenous Constitutionalism
+ Treaty Relationships (and the treaties themselves)
+ Pre-Confederation Documents (Royal Proclamation 1763)
+ Quasi-Constitutional statutes (Bill of Rights, Supreme Court Act)
+ Unwritten Constitutional Principles
+ Constitutional Conventions
+ Case Law
+ Constitutional Culture (the dominant tide)

**Reference Re Secession of Quebec:** This reference question asked whether the constitution allows for Quebec to secede should they so desire. The reference question was initiated due to rising Quebec separatism. The court found that the constitution did not allow secession but it should be changed should Quebec demand it.

+ The court stated that unwritten constitutional principles should be used to interpret the constitution.
+ The constitution sets up a robust system of federalism which by its very nature envisions a united country.
+ The constitution also holds unwritten values such as respect for democracy and subsidiarity. Therefore, should the majority of Quebec desire to leave the constitution should be changed to allow it.

**Note:** In the more recent case *British Columbia v Imperial Tobocco Canada Ltd* (2005) the supreme court stepped away from embracing the unwritten principles of the constitution.

**Reference Re Senate Reform:** This reference question asked whether the government could commit to "consultative elections" for the senate. The senators would still be appointed by the governor general but with the understanding that they would choose the person elected by the majority. In this way, the law would not require a constitutional amendment as the mechanism of appointment would go unchanged. The court held that the change would be unconstitutional.

+ The Senate is designed to be a body of "sober second thought." The framers intended that senators be appointed; any change to this model in form or substance would require a constitutional amendment.

**At a glance:**

+ Living tree) the meaning of the constitution changes with shifts in understanding of words and Canadian values
+ Dead tree) Aka: originalism. The constitution should only mean what was intended when it was written. Any changes are to be made by the democratic system, not the courts.

**Reference Re Persons:** S. 24 of the constitution states that the governor general will appoint "qualified persons" to the senate. Traditionally, the governor general only appointed men to the senate. This reference question asks whether the appointment of women to the senate would violate the constitution. The supreme court held that it would.

**Edwards v AG Canada:** This case supplanted the understanding of persons expressed in the *Persons* reference. Women were allowed to be senators.

+ Interpreters of the constitution are bound by the words but not the original intent of those words in toto.
+ Though "qualified persons" may have originally meant 'men,' this fact is not dispositive of the issue.
+ Living tree doctrine enshrined into Canadian Law.
+ Women can serve on the senate.

**National Federation of Independent Businesses v Sebelius:** This US case held that Obamacare was constitutionally valid law by the US congress. The court held that the mandate to buy health insurance was a valid use of Congress's taxing power. It did however, strike down a part of the law which would force states to accept a restructuring of medicaid.

+ US federalism is mostly the same as in Canada.
+ Canadian federalism is distinct in that local and federal powers are enshrined in the constitution. US constitution is mostly about federal power.

## Federalism

**At a glance:** The division of powers in the Canadian constitution is absolute. The federal heads of power (s. 91) and the provincial heads of power (s. 92) were intended as "watertight compartments." Over time, this view dissapeared as it became untenable. The heads of power have such a degree of overlap that effective laws must often encroach on the jurisdiction of another level of government.

Many of the cases in this section deal with economic regulation. s. 91(2) of the constitution gives power over trade and commerce to the federal government. s. 92(13) gives power of property and civil rights to the provinces. The inescapable overlap of these two heads of power motivates most of the cases below.

**Citizens Insurance v Parsons:** Parsons owned a business in Ontario which was insured by Citizens. When the business burned, Citizens refused to pay as Parsons did not disclose another policy on the business. An Ontario statute governing contracts meant Citizens would have to pay up. Citizens argued that the statute was ultra vires because it encroached on federal jurisdiction over trade and commerce. Parsons argued that the statute fell under the provincial authority over property and civil right. Parsons won.

+ The early constitutional cases dealt with overlapping powers by interpreting some heads broadly and others narrowly.
+ The property and civil rights power was interpreted broadly, whereas the trade and commerce power was read narrowly.

**Russel v The Queen:** This case is important as it is the first to deal with the residual POGG power. Russel violated the federal temperance act which prohibited alcohol. Russel held that the act violated provincial authority over, inter alia, matters of a local or private nature and the raising of funds from saloon licenses (s. 92(9)). The federal government argued that the act was valid as it full under ensuring "peace order and good government" (POGG). Russel lost.

+ POGG power trumps provincial jurisdiction
+ Test for using POGG is whether the matter is of "national concern." Temperance is of national concern.

**Hodge v The Queen:** An Ontario statute made it illegal to operate a billiard table where alcohol was sold. Hodge operated a billiard table in his licensed tavern. Hodge was convicted under the Ontario statute. Hodge argued that the Ontario statute was ultra vires as temperance legislation was federal jurisdiction according to *Russel.* Rusell lost, the act was valid.

+ This case established the double aspect doctrine: where an act in one way falls under provincial jurisdiction, yet in another aspect falls under federal jurisdiction, it may be valid.
+ The Ontario act was aimed at licensing taverns (provincial jurisdiction) but also encroached on federal temperance law.

**Reference Re The Board of Commerce Act:** The federal government set up the Board of Commerce to set limits on profits from clothing sales. This legislation sought to limit the price of clothing for consumers. The federal government argued that the acts governed a matter of national concern under POGG. The privy council held that this board encroached on provincial jurisdiction.

+ POGG is only to be used in an emergence such as war or famine.
+ Judgement based on *Parsons* case.
+ Federal authority must stay in its watertight compartment.

**Fort Frances Pulp and Paper Co. v Manitoba Free Press:** The outbreak of WWI meant that there was a radically increased demand for newspaper. The federal government thus enforced maximum paper prices to prevent price increases due to high demand. After the end of the war, the government repealed all emergency acts except for the restrictions on paper prices. Fort Frances objected that since the emergency was over, the law should not be valid. Fort Frances lost, the paper price control was valid.

+ Price controls do infringe on provincial jurisdiction but are allowed under the emergency power of POGG.
+ Though the war had ended, there was still increased demand for newsprint which necessitated the price controls under POGG.

**Toronto Electric Commissioner v Snider:** The federal government created a board to regulate labour disputes. The board had the power to prevent lockouts and give orders to employers and employees. When the board tried to intervene in a dispute between Toronto Electric and its employees, Toronto Electric argued that the federal act was ultra vires. Toronto Electric submitted that the act infringed on provincial authority over property and civil rights. Toronto Electric won, the Act was ultra vires.

+ The double aspect doctrine was inapplicable according to the PC.
+ The power over trade and commerce does **not** broadly overlap with property and civil rights.

**POGG at a glance:** The POGG power is not in the listed heads of power. Rather, it stems from the wording of the constitution itself. The POGG power allows the federal government to make sweeping legislation on matters of national concern. The POGG power cannot be used under "normal circumstances" (*Board of Commerce*). POGG is available when there is a sudden danger to the social order (*Fort Frances*) or extraordinary peril to the national life (*Snider*). *Russel* seems to stand as an exception since temperance can hardly be seen as "sudden" or imperilling the social order. In its time however, *Russel* was seen as addressing a pressing matter of public life. In summary, for POGG to be used there must be:

+ An emergency which:
+ Impacts the nation as a whole (not a specific area)

## The New Deal Cases

**At a glance:** Throughout the great depression the federal government attempted to implement policies to provide relief to struggling Canadians. These policies were generally found to be ultra vires as they fell under property and civil rights (92(13)). These new deal cases led to shift in constitutional culture as many Canadians felt shafted by the current system's inability to solve the economic crisis.

**AG Canada v AG Ontario (Labour Conventions):** The federal government attempted to implement sweeping reforms to labour laws through treaty obligations. The federal government inherited from England the power to make treaty obligations to foreign countries on behalf of the Dominion. The federal government signed a treaty which sought to limit work hours. The federal government purported to exercise its treaty power to implement the reforms. The government lost.

> "The Dominion cannot, merely by making promises to foreign countries, clothe itself with legislative authority inconsistent with the constitution which gave it birth." - Lord Atkin

+ The federal government cannot bypass the Constitution's federalism through its treaty power.

**AG Canada v AG Ontario (The Employment and Social Insurance Act)** The federal government attempted to implement a social security system. To avoid having the act found ultra vires, the federal government implemented the plan as a "tax" under the taxing power (s. 91(3)). The plan failed as the privy council ignored the pretence of a "tax;" viewing the plan as an insurance system falling under property and civil rights.

+ This case established the "pith and substance principle." An act should be viewed as falling under whatever it aims at in pith and substance, not whatever it claims to be aimed at.
