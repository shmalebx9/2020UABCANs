## Reference re the Board of Commerce Act, 1919 & the Combines and Fair Prices Act, 1919 [1922] 1 AC 191, (1920), 60 SCR 456


The court was asked whether the board had power to make a specific order setting profit margins for clothing prices in Ottawa.

### SCC
the principle which in my opinion is deducible from Parson’s Case (1881), 7 AC 96 (PC), namely that section 91(2) does not authorize an enactment by the Dominion Parliament regulating in each of the provinces the terms of the contracts of a particular business or trade,

### PC
Legislation setting up a Board of Commerce with such powers appears to their Lord-ships to be beyond the powers conferred by s. 91.

### Notes

Just another example of the courts holding that the federal government has limited power over industry. Breaking up monopolies and regulating the economy should by left up to the provinces.

# Fort Frances Pulp and Paper Company v Manitoba Free Press Company [1923] AC 695 (PC)

The outbreak of WWI meant that there was a radically increased demand for newspaper. The federal government thus enforced maximum paper prices to prevent price increases due to high demand.

Dominion Parliament cannot ordinarily legislate so as to interfere with property and civil rights.
in a very different case, such as that of sudden danger to social order arising from the outbreak of a great war, the Parliament of the Dominion can act under other powers which may well be implied in the constitution. > Unwritten constitutional principles

This concerns special circumstances of the national emergency which concern nothing short of the peace, order and good government of Canada as a whole.

After the war ended Parliament passed an act to get rid of laws enabled by the special circumstances of the war. The order then goes on to declare repealed all orders and Regulations of the Governor in Council which depend for their sanction upon s. 6 of the War Measures Act, 1914, and repeals them as from January 1, 1920. But from this repeal it expressly excepts, among other orders and Regulations specified, those relating to paper control, which are to remain in force until the end of another session of Parliament.

their Lordships find themselves unable to say that the Dominion Government had no good reason for thus temporarily continuing the paper control after actual war had ceased, but while the effects of war conditions might still be operative. > PC found that even though war had ended, the exceptional circumstances relating to increased demand for newsprint had not

### Notes

The federal government is allowed to step into provincial powers when exceptional circumstances like war necessitate the overreach to fulfil the federal government's other duties like POGG.

# Toronto Electric Commissioners v Snider [1925] AC 396 (PC), [1924] 2 DLR 761 (CA)

The federal government created a board to regulate labour disputes. The board could hear complaints and make orders to employees and employers preventing lockouts and strikes.

board was appointed to inquire into a dispute between the Toronto electric commissioners and some of its employees, and the commissioners sought an injunction, alleging that the Act was ultra vires. The ontario Court of Appeal, reversing the trial court, dismissed the claim. Ferguson JA, with whom Mulock CJo and Magee and Smith JJA concurred, wrote the judgment for the majority. he avoided relying on POGG, because he felt that its limits were not clearly settled. The Act, though, was valid under s 91(2), Trade and commerce, and s 91(27) Criminal Law.

The PC reversed the decision and found the board unconstitutional.
It is obvious that these provisions dealt with civil rights. > This is provincial, the act is ultra vires
s. 91, the power to regulate trade and commerce cannot be relied on as enabling the Dominion Parliament to regulate civil rights in the Provinces.
Appeal allowed

### Notes

Privy council found federal regulation of labour disputes unconstitutional. The power to regulate trade and commerce does not broadly overlap with civil rights according to the PC.

## 198-216, Interpretation of the Division of powers

By far the most important, and most frequently used, is the pith and substance doctrine, and we begin our survey with it. The other two main doctrines are the double aspect doctrine and the ancillary powers doctrine (or, as it is sometimes called, the necessarily incidental doctrine).


Judges need assistance in determining what head the legislation falls under. That assistance comes in the form of a direction to judges to attend not to everything that that legislation does, appears to do, or might do, but to its pith and substance, its dominant characteristic or, in common parlance, what the legislation is really all about. Once they have determined the “matter” the **“pith and substance”** of the legislation (a process the courts often refer to as the characterization process), judges can then turn their minds to which of the competing federal and provincial “classes of subjects” that “matter” can be said to “come within.”

# Katherine Swinton, The Supreme Court and Canadian Federalism: The Laskin-Dickson Years

For example, aeronautics has been held to be a federal matter under the p.o.g.g. power, as it is a matter that was not allocated by the original distribution of powers (for obvious technological reasons).

Determining the matter: The dominant form of inquiry is into purpose that is, to the problem underlying the legislation which the legislature is trying to address

While the Fathers of Confederation may have wished for exclusivity of legislative powers or “water-tight compartments” between federal and provincial governments, it became clear early in the interpretation of the constitution that there must be some overlap or entanglement between federal and provincial regulation

# William R Lederman, “Classification of Laws and the British North America Act”


For a simple illustration, take the well-known rule that a will made by an unmarried person becomes void if and when he marries. Is this a rule of “marriage” (s. 91(26)) or of “property and civil rights” (s. 92(13))? > Logic cannot tell us, it's a matter of policy

Let us suppose that the federal Government proposes to enact a heavy tax on the consumers of liquor. It can be seen that enforcement of the law will (a) bring in some revenue and (b) reduce consumption of liquor, which in turn will gladden the hearts of members of the WCTU, facilitate the diversion of more alcohol to the manufacture of explosives, and put some marginal distillers out of business. > Context determines which of these is really the "matter." In a time of war for example: the act is probably aimed at diverting alcohol to creating explosives and so this is the actual matter.

judges are beyond the aid of logic, because logic merely displays the many possible classifications, it does not assist in a choice between them

# R v Morgentaler [1993] 3 SCR 463

The question in this appeal is whether the Nova Scotia Medical Services Act, RSNS 1989, c. 281, and the regulation made under the Act, NS Reg. 152/89, are ultra vires the province of Nova Scotia on the ground that they are in pith and substance criminal law

The court found that abortion laws were unconstitutional because they violated women’s Charter guarantee of security of the person: R v. Morgentaler, [1988] > Five years earlier

The appellant argued that the Medical Services Act and the regulation are valid provincial legislation enacted pursuant to the province’s legislative authority over hospitals, health, the medical profession and the practice of medicine. It relies particularly on heads (7), (13), and (16) of s. 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867, which give the province exclusive legislative authority over [hospitals, property and civil rights, and generally all matters of a merely local or private nature]

The analysis of pith and substance is not, however, restricted to the four corners of the legislation (see, e.g., Reference re Anti-Inflation Act, [1976] 2 SCR 373, at pp. 388-89). The the court “will look beyond the direct legal effects to inquire into the social or economic purposes which the statute was enacted to achieve,”


In a nutshell, this evidence demonstrates that members of all parties in the house understood the central feature of the proposed law to be prohibition of Dr. Morgentaler’s proposed clinic on the basis of a common and almost unanimous opposition to abortion clinics per se.


The issue we face in the present case is whether Nova Scotia has, by the present legislation, regulated the place for delivery of a medical service with a view to controlling the quality and nature of its health care delivery system, or has attempted to prohibit the performance of abortions outside hospitals with a view to suppressing or punishing what it perceives to be the socially undesirable conduct of abortion. The former would place the legislation within provincial competence; the latter would make it criminal law.

# Note

The legislation was found to be in pith and substance a criminal law since it was clearly aimed at stopping M from opening his clinic. The other parts of the legislation were ancillary.

## Notes From Text 226-268

# Dobule Aspect Doctrine

The double aspect doctrine has its origins in Hodge v The Queen (1883), 9 AC 117 (PC) which stated:

>“subjects [here, the liquor trade] which in one aspect and for one purpose fall within sect. 92, may in another aspect and for another purpose fall within sect. 91.”

This case established that a law may be found valid when it is ultra vires when in another aspect it is intra vires. As stated by William R Lederman in *Classification of Laws and the British North America Act:*

>When the court considers that the federal and provincial features of the challenged rule are of roughly equivalent importance so that neither should be ignored respecting the division of legislative powers, the decision is made that the challenged rule could be enacted by either the federal parliament or a provincial legislature.

# Multiple Access Ltd v McCutcheon [1982] 2 SCR 161

In this case, Dickson J (as he then was) relies on Lederman’s understanding of the operation of the double aspect doctrine to find a double aspect over regulation of insider trading in the securities of federally incorporated companies. He thus concludes that the Ontario regulation is intra vires despite almost identical federal regulation.

**Facts:** The ontario Securities Act, RSo 1970, c 426 prohibited insider trading in shares trading on the Toronto Stock exchange. The Canada Corporations Act, RSC 1970, c C-32 had almost identical provisions, applicable to corporations incorporated under federal law.
The respondents, the alleged insider traders, argued that the ontario statute could not validly apply to their case because the regulation of the trading in shares of federally incorporated companies falls within exclusive federal jurisdiction.

**Issue:** Whether provincial legislation can be intra vires if it is almost identicle to federal legislation. Whether the Ontario legislation should be considered valid insofar as it infringes on federal jurisdiction.

**Analysis:** Dickson J reasoned that "the double aspect doctrine is applicable, as Professor Lederman says, when the contrast between the relative importance of the two features is not so sharp. When, as here, the corporate-security federal and provincial characteristics of the insider trading legislation are roughly equal in importance there would seem little reason, when considering validity, to kill one and let the other live."
He therefore found that both sets of regulation are valid and do not conflict.

**Conclusion:** Found in favour of the Ontario government.

# Ancillary Powers

The ancillary powers doctrine is used in cases where the challenge is to a part of a larger scheme of legislation, rather than to the entire scheme. When the impugned part is examined in isolation, it appears to intrude into the jurisdiction of the other level of government. However, if the larger scheme of which the impugned provision forms part is constitutionally valid, the impugned provision may also be found valid because of its relationship to the larger scheme.

# General Motors of Canada Ltd v City National Leasing [1989] 1 SCR 641

**Facts:** City National Leasing (CNL) brought a civil action against General Motors (GM), alleging that it suffered losses as a result of a discriminatory pricing policy that constituted a kind of anti-competitive behaviour prohibited by the Combines Investigation Act. The civil action was authorized by s 33.1 of the Act. GM argued that s 33.1 was beyond the jurisdiction of Parliament because the creation of civil causes of action falls within provincial jurisdiction in relation to “Property and Civil Rights.”

**Issue:** Whether the whole of an act can be considered ultra vires due to an ancillary part of the legislation. Whether an ultra vires piece of a larger piece of legislation can be considered invalid if the larger legislation is intra vires.

**Analysis:** Dickson, writing for the court, found that the Combines Investigation Act was within the federal goverment's power to regulate trade and commerce. The civil action enabled by the act was an integral part of the act. And, the civil action enabled by the act was not a serious infringement on provincial authority. He therefore found in favour of the City National Leasing.

# Quebec (Attorney General) v Lacombe 2010 SCC 38, [2010] 2 SCR 453

**Facts:** A bylaw, which was added by way of an amendment to the municipality’s general zoning bylaw, had been enacted after a vigorous lobbying campaign by the owners of summer homes and other users of a recreational lake called Gobeil Lake who objected to the operation of a private aerodrome on Gobeil Lake by a company that provided float plane sightseeing services. By its terms, by-law No 260 explicitly prohibited the construction and use of aerodromes within a particular part of the municipality that included the lake.

**Issue:** Is a municiple by-law valid if it infringes on federal authority over aviation.

**Rule:** The potentially invalid provision will be saved where it is an important part of a broader legislative scheme that is within the competence of the enacting body.

**Analysis:** The court found that on its own, the bylaw amounted to an unconstitutional trenching on federal jurisdiction over aeronautics. The court accepted that the general zoning bylaw was valid provincial legislation under s 92(13), and then proceeded to address the question whether the impugned bylaw could be upheld because of its relation-ship with the general zoning bylaw. The court went on to distinguish the ancillary powers doctrine from other rules:

## Incidental effects

>The incidental effects rule, by contrast, applies when a provision, in pith and substance, lies within the competence of the enacting body but touches on a subject assigned to the other level of government.

## Double aspect doctrine

>The fact that a matter may for one purpose and in one aspect fall within federal jurisdiction does not mean that it cannot, for another purpose and in another aspect, fall within provincial competence. By contrast, ancillary powers apply only where a legislative provision does not come within those heads of power assigned to its enacting body under the Constitution Act, 1867.

Under the rational functional test used by Laskin J.A. in Papp [v Papp, [1970 1 oR 331], and repeatedly affirmed in the jurisprudence of this Court, ancillary powers will only save a provision that is rationally and functionally connected to the purpose of the legislative scheme that it purportedly furthers. It is not enough that the measure sup-plement the legislative scheme; it must actively further it. More clearly, the impugned legislation must be an important part of the larger legislation to be saved by the ancillary powers doctrine.

The larger legislating scheme is the power of zoning. Zoning is supposed to make "zones" where similar activities are permitted, not to make blanket bans disregarding the nature and character of zones. The court found that the bylaw does not function as zoning legislation, but rather, is a stand-alone prohibition. It treats similar parcels differently, and different parcels the same, belying the first principle of zoning legislation. The bylaw therefore does not function as zoning regulation. The bylaw therefore fails the "rational functional connection" test defined in *General Motors.*

# The Interjurisdictional Immunity Doctrine

This doctrine constitutes a departure from the tendency of the pith and substance, double aspect, and ancillary powers doctrines to create overlapping jurisdiction, and is instead a doctrine that emphasizes exclusivity of jurisdiction. It is meant to safegaurd the exclusivity of jurisdiction according to the constitution where possible. To put it another way, in those circumstances where the doctrine of interjurisdictional immunity applies, valid laws are not allowed to apply in core areas of jurisdiction assigned to the other level of government, and there is no double aspect to the matter regulated.

The double aspect docrine is used in *McKay et al v R, [1965] SCR 798,* in which the question was whether a municipal bylaw that by its terms prohibited the display of all signs in a residential area, except for a few specified exceptions such as real estate signs and trespassing and safety signs, could constitutionally be applied to the McKays, residents of the municipality. The McKays had erected a sign during a federal election campaign promoting one of the local candidates and had been charged under the bylaw for having done so. Federal elections are however, federal jurisdiction.
The Mckays won the case. The judge's reasoning was based on the proposition that governments should not be permitted to do indirectly what they cannot do directly. In his view, if the municipality had enacted a bylaw targeted specifically at the erection of federal election campaign signs—the direct approach—such a bylaw would have been struck down as encroaching on exclusive federal legislative jurisdiction over federal elections. If that was so, it therefore followed that the municipality should not be allowed to enact a generally worded bylaw and then seek to apply it to the erection of federal election signs—the indirect approach.

Another case of interjurisdictional immunity striking down a law is *Commission du Salaire Minimum v Bell Telephone Company of Canada, [1966] SCR 767 (Bell No 1).* The issue in that case was whether the Quebec Minimum Wage Act, which the court accepted as valid provincial legislation, could constitutionally be applied to Bell Telephone, a federally regulated company. The Act gave the Commission du Salaire the power to regulate matters such as minimum wages, working hours, and working conditions. Bell won the case, establishing that a valid generally worded provincial law could be held not to apply to federal undertakings if it was found to “affect a vital part of their operation or management.” This test created a much larger area of immunity from provincial legislation for federal undertakings.

Because the provincial laws in issue in these cases usually appear so clearly to fall within provincial jurisdiction in most of their applications, their valid-ity is assumed (as it was in McKay, as noted above)Invalidation is not considered an option. 
Rather, it is the applicability of the law in particular circumstances that is at issue. When the interjurisdictional immunity doctrine is successfully invoked, the courts will interpret, or read down, generally worded provincial statutes so that they do not apply to matters that fall within the core of exclusive federal powers. In other words: **interjurisdictional immunity does not strike down a law, but rather limits the law's power.**

# Canadian Western Bank v Alberta 2007 SCC 22, [2007] 2 SCR 3

**Facts:** Federal banks operating in Alberta objected to provincial regulation on marketing "peace of mind insurance."

The court stated the motivation for interjurisdictional immunity:
>classes of subjects in ss. 91 and 92 must be assured a “basic, minimum and unassailable content” immune from the application of legislation enacted by the other level of government. 

The court however, resisted the appelant (banks) desire to make IJI a doctrine of first recourse in a division of powers disput. The court stated that IJI should not be invoked any time some piece of legislation **effects** another area of jurisdiction, but rather, only when it **impairs.** Impairment however does not mean the legislation must "sterilize" or "paralyze" legislation from another jurisdiction. The legislation must impair a function at the **core** of the other jurisdiction's powers. 

>Thus, the success of the appellants’ argument in this appeal depended in part on locating the promotion of “peace of mind” insurance at the core of banking. For the reasons already discussed, and particularized below, we do not believe that this aspect of the appellants’ argument can be sustained.

The banks lost the case, having failed to meet the "core" element of the test for IJI. Additionally, the court chose to apply constitution rules of interpretation in the following order:

+ Pith and substance 
+ Interjurisdictional immunity
+ Federal Paramountcy (the provincial law did not conflict)

Prior to this case, it was understood that the doctrine of interjurisdictional immunity should always be applied first. This case established that IJI should be invoked sparingly.

# Quebec (Attorney General) v Canadian Owners and Pilots Association 2010 SCC 39, [2010] 2 SCR 536

**Facts:** Two Quebec residents, Laferrière and Gervais, constructed an airstrip on a lot they owned near Shawinigan, Quebec. under the federal Aeronautics Act, the construction and operation of an airf i eld for private (as opposed to commercial) aviation is not subject to a requirement of prior permission. Registration of an aerodrome with the federal minister of transport is optional; however, if registered, a private aerodrome becomes subject to federal standards and is available to anyone who needs to land. Laferrière and Gervais registered their airstrip.
The land on which Laferrière and Gervais constructed their airstrip was within an area designated as an agricultural region under the province’s Act respecting the preservation of agricultural land and agricultural activities (“the ARPALAA” or the Act). Section 26 of the Act prohibits the use of land in a designated agricultural region for any purpose other than agriculture, unless specific authorization from the Commission de protection du territoire agricole du Québec (“the Commission”) has been granted. No such authorization had been obtained by Laferrière and Gervais, and, in 1999, the Commission ordered them to demolish the airstrip because it was located in a designated agricultural region.

**Issue:** Whether the ARPALAA infringes on federal authority over aviation to such a degree that it is ultra vires.

**Rule:**

+ Does the legislation infringe on the power of another body (the feds in this case).
+ Does the legislation infringe on the **core** of the power of another body.
+ Is the infringement serious enough to impair the power of the other body to fulfil its core function.

**Analysis:** The court found that the federal jurisdiction over aeronautics encompasses the power to determine the location of aerodromes. Therefore the act fulfils element one. The court then found that deciding the location of aerodromes is essential to the core of federal authority over aviation. As to the seriousness, Section 26 of the ARPALAA does not sterilize Parliament’s power to legislate on aeronautics; the doctrine of paramountcy would permit Parliament to legislatively override provincial zoning legislation for the purpose of establishing aerodromes. But the ARPALAA would nevertheless seriously affect the manner in which the power can be exercised. Instead of the current permissive regime, Parliament would be obliged to legislate for the specific location of particular aerodromes. Such time consumer effort to legislate against the province would impair the federal goverment in its power over aviation. The federal power is therefore immune under IJI analysis. 

**Conclusion:** COPA won the suit. The federal goverment alone can decide the placement of aerodromes. Section 26 of the Act impinges on this core in a way that impairs this federal power. If s. 26 applied, it would force the federal Parliament to choose between accepting that the province can forbid the placement of aerodromes on the one hand, or specifically legislating to override the provincial law on the other hand. This would seriously impair the federal power over aviation, effectively forcing the federal Parliament to adopt a different and more burdensome scheme for establishing aerodromes than it has in fact chosen to do.

# Paramountcy

The constitution is largely silent on the constitutionally valid way of dealing with valid conflicting provincial/federal laws. There are firm rules in a few cases:

+ Section 95 CA-1867, agriculture and immigration: federal paramountcy
+ S.92A CA-1982, export of natural resources to other provinces: federal paramountcy
+ S.94A CA-1951,1964, Old age pensions and similar benefits: Provincial paramountcy

The doctrine of federal paramountcy was developed by the courts to deal with conflicts. The doctrine is somewhat modelled on s.95

>95 In each Province the Legislature may make Laws in relation to Agriculture in the Province, and to Immigration into the Province; and it is hereby declared that the Parliament of Canada may from Time to Time make Laws in relation to Agriculture in all or any of the Provinces, and to Immigration into all or any of the Provinces; and any Law of the Legislature of a Province relative to Agriculture or to Immigration shall have effect in and for the Province as long and as far only as it is not repugnant to any Act of the Parliament of Canada.

# Tests For Paramountcy

For the courts to apply the doctrine of paramountcy there are several test they may apply including:

+ Impossibility of dual compliance: Can a citizen comply with the provincial and federal laws
+ Duplication: does the provincial legislation duplicate the federal
+ Impossibility of dual effect: Can a judge apply both rules fully in any given situation
+ Frustration of federal purpose: Does the provincial law frustrate the purpose of federal legislation (doing indirectly what they cannot do directly)
+ Federal intent to occupy the field: Has the Parliament made it's intention to occupy a field of regulation entirely (a complete regulatory scheme).

# Multiple Access Ltd v McCutcheon [1982] 2 SCR 161

This case, as discussed above, was about whether duplicative provincial legislation was rendered inoperable by the federal law it duplicates. Of interest in this section is that the court applied the impossibility of dual compliance test to come to a negative answer. The court found that there was a possibility of dual compliance and thus allowed the appeal, stating:

>In principle, there would seem to be no good reason to speak of paramountcy and preclusion except where there is actual conflict in operation as where one enactment says “yes” and the other says “no”; “the same citizens are being told to do inconsistent things”; compliance with one is defiance of the other.

From this came the duplication test. If a provincial law simply duplicates the federal, paramountcy does not apply.

# Bank of Montreal v Hall [1990] 1 SCR 121

**Facts:** Hall was a Saskatchewan farmer who took out a loan from BMO. As security, Hall gave the bank interest in a piece of farm machinery he owned. Hall defaulted on the loan. The bank immediately attempted to reposes the machinery without giving Hall notice. The Bank Act was federal legislation that gave banks the right to do exactly as BMO did. The Limitation of Civil Rights Act, RSS 1978, disallowed banks from collecting on their collateral without giving notice and going through a legal procedure. The bank sought to have the Saskatchewan legislation declared of no force or effect via federal paramountcy. The trial judge ruled in the bank's favour which was reversed by the Sask. court of appeal.

**Issue:** Does federal paramountcy apply in cases where a citizen or firm may comply with both federal and provincial law?

**Rule:** Both laws were valid so the applicable tests were those of federal paramountcy. The court expanded the test from *Multiple Access* to consider whether the provincial law conflicted with parliamentary purpose in deciding federal paramountcy. This case established that in cases where a provincial law frustrates the purpose of valid federal law, it is of no force or effect.

**Analysis:** The court found that both laws were valid intre vires law. The court held to the view that federal paramountcy applies where there is "actual conflict" between provincial and federal law. It is possible for the bank to comply with both laws by simply complying with the Sask. statute. Nothing in the sask. law compels a citizen or firm to do something disallowed by the federal law. The court elaborated that conflict needn't be constrained simply to impossibility of dual compliance. The purpose of the federal law was clear. Parliament intended to reduce the cost of recovery for banks to lower the cost of loans. The sask. statute made it difficult for banks to recover and therefore incentivised higher interest rates. There was an actual conflict in the fact that the sask. law frustrated the purpose of the Bank act.

**Conclusion:** Appeal upheld. Saskatchewan legislation declared of no force or effect.

# Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc v Saskatchewan 2005 SCC 13, [2005] 1 SCR 188

**Facts:** The federal parliament passed the *Tobacco Act, SC 1997* to regulate the sale of tobacco products. The act seriously limits the advertising of tobacco products. The act made an exception for retailers who sell tobacco; allowing them to post signage of brands and prices. Saskatchewan passed the *The Tobacco Control Act, SS 2001.* The provincial law banned all advertising of tobacco products in establishments open to those under 18. Tobacco companies in sask. sued on the grounds that the provincial law was of no force or effect due to federal paramountcy.

**Issue:** Whether the Tobacco Control act is sufficiently inconsistent with the Tobacco Act to render it inoperative pursuant to the doctrine of federal paramountcy.

**Rule:** If the provincial law creates an impossibility of dual compliance it is inoperative. If the provincial law frustrates the purpose of the federal legislation it is inoperative.

**Analysis:** Both laws are valid and intre vires. The federal law was created under the federal power over criminal law. Criminal law is prohibitory in nature, it does not create rights. In order for the provincial law to be incompatible by impossibility of dual compliance, the provincial law must allow something banned in the federal law. Since the provincial law only makes regulations stricter it cannot conflict with another prohibitory statute. The purpose of the federal legislation is to limit sale of tobacco to minors. The sask. law only makes it **more** difficult for tobacco companies to sell to minors. Therefore, dual compliance is possible and there is no frustration of purpose.

**Conclusion:** Appeal allowed. Both laws stand legally enforceable.

# Alberta (Attorney General) v Moloney 2015 SCC 51, [2015] 3 SCR 327

**Intro:** This case further explains the dual compliance test. Two members of the court, writing through Justice Côté, argued for a strict interpretation of that test, while the other seven members, writing through Justice Gascon, adopted a more flexible interpretation.

**Facts:** The Alberta government issued a traffic ticket to Maloney under the provincial *Transit Safety Act.* After getting the ticket, Maloney declared bankruptcy. According to the federal *Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act,* once bankruptcy is effected, no debts are recoverable. The TSA provides that one can have their license revoked for unpaid tickets. The Alberta government revoked Maloney's license for non-payment. Maloney sued, alleging that Alberta could not recover the ticket as it was superseded by the federal BIA.

**Issue:** Is a provincial law inoperative if dual compliance is possible but extremely difficult? Is the provincial claim to the ticket enforceable?

**Rule:** Dual compliance test. Federal purpose test.

**Analysis:** Alberta argued that there was no impossibility of dual compliance. Maloney could refuse to pay and have his license revoked. As long as Alberta does not enforce the debt *qua debt* there is no incompatibility. The court found that in a case like this one, the test for operational conflict cannot be limited to asking whether the respondent can comply with both laws by renouncing the protection afforded to him or her under the federal law or the privilege he or she is otherwise entitled to under the provincial law. The court found that effectively, the provincial law denied a right granted by the federal law, namely, the removal of all fiduciary obligations. In this light, the law fails the dual compliance test. Additionally, the federal purpose is clear: to provide a clean slate through bankruptcy. The provincial law thus fails the frustration of federal purpose test.

**Conclusion:** Provincial law is inoperative in enforcing debt against those who declare bankruptcy.

**Concurrence:** The concurring justices agreed that the provincial law failed the frustration of federal purpose test. They however, found that the impossibility of dual compliance test was not met. Though dual compliance was difficult, it is still possible for Maloney to comply with both laws by not driving.

# Re: Anti-Inflation Act [1976] 2 SCR 373

**Facts:** In the late 70's, the federal parliament introduced sweeping regulations to combat inflation. The legislation exempted the provincial public sector unless the provinces opted in. A reference question was submitted to determine whether the regulations were authorized under *peace order and good government.*

**Issue:** Whether a law regulating sweeping areas of industry could be considered valid under pogg. Whether there was a sufficient national emergency to justify federal encroachment into provincial jurisdiction.

**Rule:** The federal government has the power to retain pogg during an emergency.

**Analysis:** The court rejected the argument that the exemptions in the legislation indicated that there was no national emergency. The court also found that the law was partially enabled by the federal goverment's control over monetary policy. The analysis of pogg and federal jurisdiction are not strictly severable. The federal government did not use an emergency to broadly seize control of provincial jurisdiction. Rather, the federal legislation, which in pith and substance is monetary policy, is extended via pogg into provincial trade and commerce.

**Dissent:** Beetz J. dissented. Justice Beetz strongly rejected the federal claim that they had authority as the problem of inflation was of national concern *(Canada Temperance Federation).* He proceeded by reductio ad absurdum. If the federal goverment could claim authority over the entire economy because it is of national concern then their powers are practically endless. He also argued that if emergency were to be invoked, it must be explicit. Emergencies are rare and pressing, if it is not clear to any reasonable person that there is an emergency then the government should not invoke its extraordinary power.

# R v Crown Zellerbach Canada Ltd [1988] 1 SCR 401

**Facts:** The *Ocean Dumping Control act* was enacted by parliament. The act seeks to protect the marine environment from pollution pursuant to Candad's international treaty obligations. The respondent runs a logging business operating on Vancouver Island in provincial waters. The respondent operates the business under a provincial license. In 1980 the respondent scooped woodwaste from the ocean floor directly adjacent to the coast and deposited it 60-80 out to sea. The entire area affected is within a cove under provincial jurisdiction. Zellerbach was charged with ocean dumping in violation of the federal act. The trial judge dismissed the charges as ultra vires. The judgement was upheld by the BCCA.

**Issue:** Whether POGG justifies sweeping legislation over provincial waters.

**Rule:** The emergency powers test of POGG. The national concern test of POGG.

**Analysis:** The court immediately dispensed with the emergency powers test as there is no emergency. The majority laid out the principles of the national concern doctrine of POGG:

+ It is is separate from the emergency powers doctrine as it does not give only temporary powers.
+ It relates to matters which did not exist at confederation (ex: Aeronautics) or which were merely local at confederation but have since become national.
+ The thing regulated must be singular and distinct to make it discernible from local matters. 
+ In order to conclude whether the matter meets the singleness standard one must consider the effects of a provincial failure to regulate the matter would have on other provinces.

Marine pollution, because of its predominantly extra-provincial as well as international character and implications, is clearly a matter of concern to Canada as whole. The fact that fresh waters are immune from regulation under the act militates against its being considered single/indivisible. Fresh water and salt water are however, sufficiently different in terms of reaction to pollution to be validly separated in the regulation scheme. Additionally, the distinction between waters lessens the impact on provincial jurisdiction, which also favours a finding of constitutionality. The respondent claims that regulation over non-pollutant dumping like the one in question in the case calls the validity of the legislation into question. The respondent contends that regulation over this type of dumping demonstrates that the legislation in this case is not aimed at preventing pollution. The court however, concluded that the only reasonable way to regulate pollutant dumping was to regulate all dumping. The legislation therefore, succeeds in passing the relevant tests for the national concern doctrine of POGG.

**Conclusion:** s. 4(1) of the Ocean Dumping Control Act is constitutionally valid as enacted in relation to a matter falling within the national concern doctrine of the peace, order and good government power of the Parliament of Canada, and, in particular, that it is constitutional in its application to the dumping of waste in the waters of Beaver Cove. Appeal allowed.

**Dissent:** La Forest J (Beetz and Lamer JJ concurring). The full range of things prohibited by the act fail to meaningfully support the stated goal. The legislation goes far beyond simply prohibiting pollution. Even if pollution was the only concern, the legislative scope would still be far too wide. Since air pollution eventually affects the ocean, the federal government could regulate provincial matters of immense scale if this act were found intra vires. The legislation in question does not limit itself to pollutant activities, nor necessarily even those close to the coasts. Effectively, a negative reply to the constitutional question would allow the federal government control over moving a single rock within any province. The act therefore has too far-reaching an impact on provincial jurisdiction to be considered valid. Appeal dismissed.

# Aboriginal Rights and Title

**S. 32.** Aboriginal rights were enshrined as part of Canada's Constitution Act of 1982. Specifically, s.32 of the new constitution act states:

>“the existing aboriginal and treaty rights of the aboriginal peoples of Canada are hereby recognized and affirmed"

Premiers such as Peter Lougheed hoped that the phrasing of the section would prevent the creation of "new" aboriginal rights. Specifically, the ambiguous wording was meant to protect the future natural resource rights of the provinces. This forced the courts to interpret what s.32 actually means in **R v Sparrow.**

## R v Sparrow [1990] 1 SCR 1075

**Facts:** Sparrow was fishing in the Fraser river. Sparrow's Musqueam nation had been using the river to fish for salmon since pre-contact. The Fisheries Act forbade the use of nets over 25 metres. Sparrow used a longer net and was charged with violating the fisheries act. Sparrow argued that his right to fish was protected under s.35 of the Constitution Act. 

**Issue:** Does the regulation on net size violate Sparrow's rights under s.35?

**Rule:** The test for whether something is an aboriginal right is whether it was a right exercised by indigenous people and not extinguished prior to 1982. This means that the right is aimed at perserving a traditional practice *of the nation in question.*

+ It may be true that the right is regulated but not extinguished.

The burden is on the Crown to prove that the right has been extinguished. The test for whether the right is extinguished is whether the parliament clearly and plainly intended to eliminate the right.

Once the right is established, the party challenging the statute must show that it interferes with the right. This court will consider:

+ First, is the limitation unreasonable?
+ Second, does the regulation impose undue hardship? 
+ Third, does the regulation deny to the holders of the right their preferred means of exercising that right?

If the Crown fails in proving extinguishment they must meet the test for just interference with a right recognized and affirmed by s.35. The Crown must demonstrate that the impugned statute:

+ Has a valid legislative objective.
+ Preserves the honour of the Crown: gives top priority to indigenous concerns over the concerns of others (due to the fiduciary relationship).
+ The objective is compelling and substantial (ex: conservation).

**Analysis:** Evidence given at trial clearly demonstrated a long-standing Musqueam practice of fishing for food. This practice justifies the right in question (fishing for food). The court found that the Crown failed to demonstrate that the right to fish for food had been extinguished. The analysis then turned to whether the government could infringe on this right. The court found that it could for a compelling and substantial reason. The court then found that the findings of fact necessary for this analysis had not been made at trial. A new trial was accordingly ordered.

**Conclusion:** New trial ordered.

## R v Van der Peet [1996] 2 SCR 507

**Facts:** The appellant Dorothy Van der Peet (V), a member of the Sto:lo nation, sold 10 salmon which she had caught. V was charged under s. 61(1) of the Fisheries Act, RSC 1970, c. F-14, with the offence of selling fish caught under the authority of an Indian food fish licence. The license V used to catch the fish only permitted the catching of fish for personal use. V argued that she had a pre-existing aboriginal right to sell fish.

**Issue:** Does s.35 of the constitution allow V to sell fish?

**Rule:** In order for a practice to form the basis of an aboriginal right it must be:

+ A practice which existed prior to European contact
+ A distinctive practice (makes the society what it is)

**Analysis:** The appellant needs to establish that selling fish is equivalent to a pre-existing indigenous practice of her nation. The appellant did not sell fish in a substantial quantity. Therefore, V need not prove that commercial fishing is equivalent to a distinctive pre-contact practice. V must prove that her nation exchanged fish for something equivalent to goods and services (barter). The court rejected the appellants claim that aboriginal rights should be interpreted more broadly. The court relied on several findings of facts from the trial judge:

1. prior to contact, exchanges of fish were only “incidental” to fishing for food purposes
2. there was no “regularized trading system” among the Sto:lo prior to contact
3. the trade engaged in between the Sto:lo and the hudson’s Bay Company, while certainly of significance to the Sto:lo society of the time, was found by the trial judge to be qualitatively different from that which was typical of the Sto:lo culture prior to contact.
4. the Sto:lo exploitation of the fishery was not specialized and that suggested that the exchange of fi sh was not a central part of Sto:lo culture.

These facts demonstrated that V failed to make out an aboriginal right to sell fish.

**Conclusion:** Appeal dismissed. There was no distinctive pre-contact Sto:lo practice of selling fish.

## R v SAPPIER & R v GRAY

**Facts:** The Maliseet and Mi'kmaq nations of New Brunswick argued they had a s.35 right to harvest wood for personal use. They based this right on their pre-contact practices of canoe-making and basket weaving.

**Analysis:** The right cannot be construed as a right to wood per se. To do so would be to make it akin to a common-law property right. The right must be specific enough to relate to the actual traditional practices adduced as evidence. To construe the right too specifically to things like basket-weaving and canoe-making leads to undue racialist reduction of indigenous cultures. The practices can be defined as "the harvesting of wood for domestic purposes."

>"I have already explained that we must discard the idea that the practice must go to the core of a people’s culture. The fact that harvesting wood for domestic uses was undertaken for survival purposes is sufficient, given the evidence adduced at trial, to meet the integral to a distinctive culture threshold."

**Conclusion:** Right Granted.

## Aboriginal Title

Radical or underlying Crown title is subject to Aboriginal land interests where  they are established.

+ Aboriginal title gives the Aboriginal group the right to use and control the land  and enjoy its benefits.
+ Governments can infringe Aboriginal rights conferred by Aboriginal title but only  where they can justify the infringements on the basis of a compelling and substantial purpose and establish that they are consistent with the Crown’s fiduciary duty to the group.
+ Resource development on claimed land to which title has not been established  requires the government to consult with the claimant Aboriginal group.
+ Governments are under a legal duty to negotiate in good faith to resolve claims to  ancestral lands.

## Tsilhqot’in Nation v British Columbia 2014 SCC 44, [2014] 2 SCR 256

**Facts:** The Tsilhqot’in nation made a claim to their ancestral lands where the BC government was planning development. The province went ahead with development in spite of the claim. The trial judge found that the Tsilhqot’in had a valid claim to aboriginal title. The province appealed. The appeals court found that the area in question was not sufficiently occupied. The Tsilhqot’in were a nomadic people and therefore never fully settled a singular area.

**Issue:** What proof must be adduced to obtain aboriginal title. What are the government's responsibilities towards aboriginal title and title claims.

**Rule:** To ground Aboriginal title a nation must show pre-contact occupation of the land in question. The occupation must be:

+ Sufficient ("intensively used")
+ Continuous 
+ Exclusive
+ To a definite area

**Analysis:** The supreme court held that the appeals court's standard for sufficiency was far too strict. The Tsilhqot’in were nomadic and it would be unreasonable to secure an interest only in tiny areas where they often returned. Such a standard would result in "islands" of title surrounded by Crown land. Additionally, the land in question had a low carrying capacity, so a larger claim is completely reasonable. The court defined the correct standard of sufficiency as:

>"There must be evidence of a strong presence on or over the land claimed, manifesting itself in acts of occupation that could reasonably be interpreted as demonstrating that the land in question belonged to, was controlled by, or was under the exclusive stewardship of the claimant group"

The court also found that this occupation was continuous and exclusive. The court then considered what rights Aboriginal title confers. The court found that it was similar to a fee simple but without the right to sell or seriously devalue the land (disenfranchising future generations). The nation holding title has the right to:

+ Decide how the land will be used
+ enjoyment and occupancy of the land
+ possess the land
+ the economic benefits of the land
+ pro-actively use and manage the land

The Crown can still infringe on these rights if they can show it is justified under s.35. The Crown must show that there is an overriding public good to justify incursion. This involves showing (*Sparrow*):

1. that it discharged its procedural duty to consult and accommodate, 
2. that its actions were backed by a compelling and substantial objective
3. that the governmental action is consistent with the Crown’s fiduciary obligation to the group (rational connection to purpose, minimal impairment, proportionality of impact)

The court found that the honour of the Crown required that the Province consult the Tsilhqot’in on uses of the lands and accommodate their interests. The Province did neither.

**Conclusion:** The Aboriginal title was granted to the land in question. The court found that the province had breached its fiduciary responsibility. Appeal allowed.
