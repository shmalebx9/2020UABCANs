# Reading Notes 

## Sources of Evidentiary Rules (CB 86)

There are two main sources of rules relating to the admissibility and gathering of evidence in criminal proceedings:

+ The Common law (eg. Hearsay rule)
+ The Charter (eg. 10b right to counsel)
    + There are also a few statutory rules in the *Criminal Code* and the *Canada Evidence Act*

## Admisibility (CB 86)
In general, evidence is admissible if)

+ the evidence is relevant to a fact at issue
+ the probative outweighs the prejudicial
+ it is not excluded by any statutory or common law rule
+ it is not excluded under the charter

## Confession Rules (CB 86)
In General, statements made outside court cannot be introduced as evidence of the truth of their contents (Hearsay). There are however, exceptions for confessions made outside the court to a third person or overheard by a third person. If the confession is made to an agent of the state (police officer) then the crown must prove the following before the confession is admissible)

+ The confession was voluntary (not given in exchange for reward or to avoid punishment)
+ The confession was the product of an "operating mind"
+ The confession was not elicited in "oppressive" circumstances

In the case of "Mr. Big" operations, the SCC found in R v. Hart that the crown must prove the probative outweighs the prejudicial before entering the confession as evidence.^[test footnote]

## Right to Cousel

>10. Everyone has the right on arrest or detention
>(a) to be informed promptly of the reasons therefor;
>(b) to retain and instruct counsel without delay and to be informed of that right; and
>(c) to have the validity of the detention determined by way of habeas corpus and to be released if the detention is not lawful.

Charter 10(b) gives the accused who have been detained the right to)

+ Be informed that they have the right to counsel
+ Retain and instruct counsel without delay

When 10(b) is not followed the evidence may still be admitted if)

+ The accused is not reasonably diligent in exercising their rights
+ or) there are exigent circumstances

Once the 10(b) right is engaged the police must

+ provide the accused with reasonable access to counsel
+ refrain form questioning until the accused has consulted counsel
    + the right to counsel may be waived by the accused as long as they do it with full knowledge of the consequences

## Exclusion of Evidence on Charter claim (CB 145)

>24. (1) Anyone whose rights or freedoms, as guaranteed by this Charter, have been infringed or denied may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to obtain such remedy as the court considers appropriate and just in the circumstances. Marginal note:Exclusion of evidence bringing administration of justice into disrepute (2) Where, in proceedings under subsection (1), a court concludes that evidence was obtained in a manner that infringed or denied any rights or freedoms guaranteed by this Charter, the evidence shall be excluded if it is established that, having regard to all the circumstances, the admission of it in the proceedings would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.

When making a charter claim, the burden of proof is on the accused to show their rights were infringed upon **and** that this infringement led to the collection of the evidence which the accused seeks to have excluded. The accused must prove)

+ That their charter rights were infringed
+ That the infringement led to the evidence in question
	+ does not need to be a strict causal link, the collection of the evidence must be "not too remote" from the breach
+ That the admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute

## Search, Seizure, and the Right to Privacy (CB 185-186)

>8. Everyone has the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure.

For a charter 8 challenge the accused must)

+ have a privacy interest recognized by the courts
+ the activities must be describable as "search," or "seizure"
+ the activity must have been performed by state agents

Generally, for a search to be considered reasonable it must)

+ Be done by a peace officer
+ be done under the authority of a search warrant
+ the warrant must be obtained prior to the search
+ the warrant must be issued by a judicial officer

In order for police to obtain a warrant an peace officer must provide sworn testimony to a judicial officer as to demonstrating the reasonable belief that *particular* evidence pertaining to a *particular* crime exists in the indicated place to be searched. Searches without warrant are presumptively unreasonable.

# R v Le

One evening, three police officers noticed four Black men and one Asian man in the backyard of a townhouse at a Toronto housing co-operative. The young men appeared to be doing nothing wrong.

--

Officers noticed five men, 4 black, one asian (Le) in the backyard of a housing co-operative. The officers entered the backyard despite the men seemingly doing nothing wrong. One officer patrolled the perimeter of the property, stepped over the fence and yelled at one young man to keep his hands where the officer could see them. Another officer issued the same order.

--

Mr. Le fled, was pursued and arrested, and found to be in possession of a firearm, drugs and cash.

--

In convicting Mr. Le, the trial judge held that he lacked standing to advance a s. 8 claim, there being no objective reasonableness

--

A majority at the Court of Appeal for Ontario agreed, accepting that, had it found breaches, it would not have excluded the evidence as any breach would have been “technical, inadvertent, and made in good faith”

----

issues: 

1. whether this encounter between the police and Mr. Le infringed his right to be free from arbitrary detention; and 
2. whether an invited houseguest enjoys a reasonable expectation of privacy while on the host’s premises.

----

the circumstances of the police entry into the backyard effected a detention that was both immediate and arbitrary

----

This was serious Charter-infringing police misconduct, with a correspondingly high impact on Mr. Le’s protected interests. Indeed, it was precisely this sort of police conduct that the Charter was intended to abolish. On balance, the admission of the evidence would, in our view, bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 
We would, therefore, allow the appeal, exclude the evidence seized from Mr. Le, set aside his convictions and enter acquittals.

----

the stature of the fence (calling it a “little two-foot fenc[e]” or a “little mini fence” (A.R., vol. I, at p. 
196)), each acknowledged its significance. That is, all officers understood the backyard was private property

----

This common police practice of asking individuals who they are and demanding proof of their identities for no apparent reason has its own name. It is known as “carding”

----

the analysis of whether s. 9 of the Charter has been infringed proceeds in two stages. The first stage inquires into whether the claimant was detained at all. If that leads to the conclusion that the claimant was detained, the second stage of analysis inquires into whether the detention was arbitrary. Both stages attract a correctness standard of review.

----

he was detained when the police entered the backyard and made contact. 
Since no statutory or common law power authorized his detention at that point

----

the determination of the timing of the detention is not advanced by repeating that the police officers had “legitimate investigatory purposes”, “valid investigatory objectives”, “legitimate investigative aims”, “valid investigatory purposes” and were conducting a “legitimate investigation”

----

The legitimacy of any investigation in the context of s. 9 is measured against whether these objectives give rise to reasonable suspicion or not.

----

The legitimacy of any investigation in the context of s. 9 is measured against whether these objectives give rise to reasonable suspicion or not. 
We conclude that they did not and that the detention was therefore arbitrary.

----

While not determinative, when the police enter a private residence as trespassers, it both colours what happens subsequently and strongly supports a finding of detention at that point in time.

----

he is described as being 20 years old, of Asian descent, and of small stature.

----

A reasonable person in the shoes of the accused is deemed to know about how relevant race relations would affect an interaction between police officers and four Black men and one Asian man in the backyard of a townhouse at a Toronto housing co-operative.

----

supports a conclusion that a detention arose as soon as the police entered the backyard

----

Merely because an individual has had repeated interactions with the police does not mean that the individual has acquired a level of sophistication in dealing with the police

----

The appellant testified that he believed he was free to leave the backyard after the police had entered and began questioning the young men. In other words, he did not think he was detained

----

A reasonable person who has been stopped by the police on multiple prior occasions would more likely perceive that it is necessary to simply submit to police demands.

----

Mr. Le’s level of sophistication

----

the Crown has argued that claimants’ subjective perceptions about whether or not they were detained are “highly relevant”. We do not accept this argument. It remains, and should remain, that the detention analysis is principally objective in nature.

----

and was, therefore, arbitrary. None of the investigative purposes found by the trial judge authorized the officers’ actions, and they were themselves trespassers.

----

a suspect’s presence in a “so-called high crime area” is not by itself a basis for detention

----

Seriousness of the Charter-Infringing Conduct

----

[t]his was serious police misconduct

----

b) Impact on the Charter-Protected Interests of the Accused

----

Regardless of how it is framed, there simply were no grounds, let alone reasonable grounds, to suspect any criminal wrongdoing was committed or being committed by the young men in the backyard. The discovery of the evidence was only possible because of the serious s. 9 breach in this case.

----

How, then, are we to understand the impact of this police misconduct on Mr. Le’s Charter-protected interest in his liberty from unjustified state interference?

----

Society’s Interest in Adjudication of the Case on its Merits

----

to abolish. Admission of the fruits of that conduct would bring the administration of justice into disrepute

----

An “adjudication on the merits”, in a rule of law state, presupposes an adjudication grounded in legality and respect for longstanding constitutional norms.

----

On balance, this line of inquiry provides support for admitting the evidence.

----

This is precisely the sort of police conduct that the Charter was intended to protect against.

----

Le wins and is aquitted.

# R v Collins

**Facts:** Constable Rodine was at a hotel to investigate possible drug crime. Richard Collins and his wife Ruby were at the hotel bar and were seen going to and from their car and various hotel rooms. The RCMP arrested Richard after he left the hotel and found him in possession of drugs. Rodine went back to the hotel to arrest Ruby. Upon seeing Ruby in the bar he quickly approached her, grabbed her by the throat, and asked to to open her hand. Ruby complied and opened her hand to reveal a green balloon full of drugs. The officer grabbed Ruby by the throat to prevent her from swallowing the evidence in the balloon. The legislation which the police claims enabled the invasive search is s. 10(1) of the Narcotic Control Act, R.S.C. 1970, c.
N-1, as amended, as that section read prior to the
amendments of December 1985:

> 10. (1) A peace officer may, at any time,
(a) without a warrant enter and search any place
other than a dwelling-house, and under the authority of
a writ of assistance or a warrant issued under this
section, enter and search any dwelling-house in which
he reasonably believes there is a narcotic by means of
or in respect of which an offence under this Act has
been committed;
(b) search any person found in such place; and
(c) seize and take away any narcotic found in such place.

**Issue:** Whether officer Rodine's search was a s.8 charter breach. Whether the breach necessitates exclusion under 24(2) ^[This case is pre-grant, so the 24(2). analysis is no longer used]

**Rule:** Once a it is determined that a search is warrantless the crown has the burden of proof on a balance of probabilities that the search was reasonable. Specifically in this case, the crown had to prove that the search was not arbitrary as officer Rodine had reasonable suspicion.

**Analysis:** At trial court the crown asked officer Rodine to explain why he searched Collins. In attempting to answer, the officer was stopped by the defence on a hearsay objection. The court found that the hearsay rule does not apply in establishing reasonable suspicion. The court was therefore unable to establish whether the search was reasonable since the officer could not explain what initiated the search. The court also took serious issue with the use of force but chose not to comment further other than to say the officer should give reason for his actions at a new trial.

**Conclusion:** Appeal allowed and new trial ordered to determine the reasonableness of the search.

# R v Patrick 2009 SCC 17

**Facts:** The appellant, Patrick, was convicted on drug charges after police found evidence of drug manufacturing in his garbage. On several occasions the police reached into P's yard and took garbage he left on the edge of his property for garbage pickup. Patrick appealed his conviction, claiming that the search of his garbage was a s.8 breach.

**Issue:** If the police breached the appellant’s s. 8 Charter right, whether the evidence seized by the police from the search of the appellant’s dwelling-house and garage, and a second dwelling-house should be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter

**Rule:** s.8 protects the privacy of individuals against the state where this privacy would be reasonably assumed. Thus, the test for a s.8 breach is whether a reasonable person would conclude that the accused's continued assertion of a privacy interest is unreasonable in the totality of the circumstances. This includes investigating:

1. What was the nature or subject matter of the evidence gathered by the police? 
2. Did the appellant have a direct interest in the contents? 
3. Did the appellant have a subjective expectation of privacy in the informational content of the garbage? 
4. If so, was the expectation objectively reasonable?

**Analysis:** The court found that the content of the garbage bags is private and informational.
>Residential waste includes an enormous amount of personal information about what is going on in our homes, including a lot of DNA on household tissues, highly personal records (e.g., love letters, overdue bills and tax returns) and hidden vices (pill bottles, syringes, sexual paraphernalia, etc.).

On this analysis, P clearly had a privacy interest in his garbage as it was information regarding lifestyle and personal habits in the privacy of his home. Though P did place the bags in plain view, their contents were hidden. It is possible then, that P still had a subjective belief that the content of the bags was private. The court found that objectively, any expectation of privacy over garbage is unreasonable. If there is some privacy interest in garbage (which there is) then it must become unenforceable at some point before the total degradation of the garbage at the dump. The court found that the point at which garbage is left out for collection is a reasonable line to draw where there is no longer a reasonable expectation of privacy. The court rejected the Crown's claim that the police did not trespass but did not consider the trespass considerable enough to exclude the evidence.

**Conclusion:** The court found that P had abandoned his privacy interest in the contents of the garbage bags gathered up by the police when he placed them in the garbage alcove open to the laneway ready for collection. Thus there was no charter breach and the evidence is admissible. Appeal dismissed.

# Onus of Proof in Criminal Cases

The “principles of fundamental justice” include: 

1. the presumption of innocence and the Crown’s burden to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt
2. the *nullum crimen* principle, which entails that: 
	a. conduct must not be punished unless it constituted an offence at the time of commission
	b. the law must be sufficiently clear and determinate to intelligibly circumscribe the conduct of persons and the authority of the state to enforce the law
3. the requirement that conduct must have a sufficient connection to the interests of the prosecuting state to support prosecution by that state
4. the requirement that the accused be sufficiently morally blameworthy to warrant conviction and punishment for a particular type of offence, which entails that: 
	a. the accused have committed a culpable act or omission, accompanied by
	b. the fault requisite for conviction and punishment. 

There are three main standards of proof: 

1. Proof beyond a reasonable doubt, which is the standard that applies to the Crown’s burden to prove actus reus and mens rea: this standard is set by the common law and s. 11(d) of the Charter. The doubt needn't be explained by reason, just possible in the mind of a reasonable person.
2. Proof on a balance of probabilities, which is the standard that an accused must meet for proving a Charter limitation, and the standard that a plaintiff must meet in a civil case
3. “Evidence to the contrary” — or raising a reasonable doubt, which is the standard that an accused must meet to rebut certain statutory presumptions.

To make an argument a party must present evidence and have that evidence meet a certain standard of proof. In general, the party that makes a pleading (claim) bears the burden of proof. A case-to-meet is the low standard of proof needed to convince a trier of law that evidence should be put before the trier of fact (be considered). 

# Woolmington v The Director of Public Prosecutions, [1935] AC 462 House of Lords

**Facts:** Reginald Woolmington shot his wife after she left him to live with her mother. A witness heard W enter the home, an argument ensue, the gun go off, and witnessed W mount his bike and flee the scene. Upon arrest W stated to police

>“I want to say nothing, except I done it, and they can do what they like with me. It was jealousy I suppose. Her mother enticed her away from me. I done all I could to get her back. That’s all."

Reginald later claimed at trial that he only took the gun to threaten suicide and the gun went off by accident. The judge explained to the jury that when someone dies "through the act of another," murder is presumed. The jury was charged not to find murder only if W provided sufficient evidence. W appealed on the ground that the judge erred telling the jury that W was presumed guilty.

**Issue:** Whether it is correct to say that there may arise in the course of a criminal trial a situation at which it is incumbent upon the accused to prove his innocence?

**Rule:** It is the role of the prosecution to prove their case. It is the role of the jury to determine whether the prosecution has proven its case.

**Analysis:** If a judge states that a plaintiff must prove his innocence then he usurps the duty of the jury by determining at the outset that the prosecution has proven its case. Additionally, the burden of proof rests on the prosecution, not the accused. In this case, the trial judge instructed the jury that it was incumbent on W to prove his innocence, which is an error.

**Conclusion:** Appeal reversed and conviction quashed. New trial ordered.

# R v W.(D). [1991] 1 SCR 742

**Facts:** WD was accused by TW of sexually assaulting her. The only evidence other than testimony was that WD was a type A secretor and semen on TW's panties was from a type A secretor. The semen evidence was not very valuable since over 30% of the population is a type A secretor. After the initial charge, the Crown requested a recharge addressing the issue of credibility. The judge stated in the short recharge:

>If in fact you believe the accused then clearly nothing took place and in fact the Crown will have failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he is guilty as charged. On the other hand if you in fact believe the complainant totally, then he is guilty as charged.

The jury found WD guilty. WD appealed on the grounds that the judge erred in the recharge.

**Issue:** Whether the error made by the judge in the recharge is reversible (negated) in light of the correct instructions as to the standard of proof given in the original charge.

**Rule:** Judges are to explain to jurors the correct standard of proof (beyond a reasonable doubt) in a criminal trial. Judges should explain that if the jurors do not believe the accused but still have a reasonable doubt they must acquit.

**Analysis:** During the recharge the trial judge erred in that he characterized the core issue to be determined by the jury as whether they believed the complainant or whether they believed the appellant. In the initial charge however, the judge thoroughly instructed the jury on the correct standard of proof. The original charge was much longer than the recharge and only a few minutes passed between the two charges. When read together, the charge as a whole adequately stressed the concept of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Since the recharge was only a minor part of the larger charge, it is reasonable to assume the jury would have understood proof beyond a reasonable doubt as important. 

**Conclusion:** Appeal dismissed, conviction upheld.

**Dissent:** Sopinka J dissented stating:

>In my opinion, at the very least the jury would be uncertain as to which version was correct and it is pure speculation that they would have accepted the first version rather than the second version which was characterized by the trial judge as “better”. This takes on additional significance in light of the statement to the jury that the charge might contain errors that would necessitate a recharge.

# R. v. Layton (C.A.), 2009 SCC 36.

**Facts:** Layton was convicted of sexual assault in a case relying on testimony. In the Judge's charge they explained proof beyond a reasonable doubt according to formulation developed in R v Lifchus. The judge also provided the jury with a 71 page written version of the charge. On page 15, the charge characterized 'proof beyond a reasonable doubt' as laying between a 'balance of probabilities' and 'absolute' certainty, but much closer to absolute certainty. The jury submitted a question asking for a definition of 'balance of probabilities,' specifically citing page 15 of the charge. The judge did not explain balance of probabilities, but rather restated the original charge with emphasis on reasonable doubt. Layton was convicted and appealed, the appeal court overturned the conviction, the crown appealed to the supreme court.

**Issue:** Whether a restatement of a charge suffices to discharge a judge's duty to instruct the jury. Whether the judges answer to the jury left the jury with an understanding of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

**Rule:** Judges must charge the jury with an apprehension of the correct standard of proof. 

**Analysis:** There were two problems with what she said after repeating her reasonable doubt instruction. The first was the judge’s statement that every attempt to explain the words “reasonable doubt” leads to more confusion as opposed to clarity. The second was that the judge said that there was very little that she could add to clarify reasonable doubt. The judge thereby did not clarify the jury's question and discouraged them from coming back with another question if they still did not understand. There can be little doubt that the jury understood 'balance of probabilities' after the recharge.

**Conclusion:** Appeal dismissed. New trial ordered in keeping with the appeals court.

Presumptions requiring proof of a basic fact are typically statutory. 
Criminal Code 258(1)(a) provides as follows: 
where it is proved that the accused occupied the seat or position ordinarily occupied by a person who operates a motor vehicle the accused shall be deemed to have had the care or control of the vehicle.

No Basic Fact Presumptions that do not require proof of a basic fact include the presumption of innocence and the presumption of sanity. No facts need be proved for innocence or sanity to be considered to be the case.

The accused is entitled to rebut the presumption of sanity by proving mental disorder on a balance of probabilities.

Conclusive presumptions cannot be rebutted by any evidence. Such presumptions are rare and statutory. 
One example is found in Criminal Code 198(2): “a place that is found to be equipped with a slot machine shall be conclusively presumed to be a common gaming house.” (This provision has been held to be inoperative under the Charter

An example of a common law permissive presumption is the “doctrine of recent possession.” If an accused is found in unexplained possession of recently stolen property, an inference may (not must) be drawn that the accused has the guilty knowledge required for conviction for theft or possession of stolen property.

Rebuttable presumptions operate as follows: on proof of the basic fact, the presumed fact is presumed to be the case; the accused, however, may rebut the presumption by tendering some evidence acceptable to the trier of fact. Some rebuttable presumptions are rebutted only if the accused establishes some fact on a balance of probabilities. Other presumptions only require the accused to provide some or any “evidence to the contrary” to rebut the presumption. “Evidence to the contrary” refers to evidence merely raising a reasonable doubt.

Mandatory presumptions limit s. 11(d) rights. They remove the burden from the Crown to prove each element of the offence; the presumption allows the Crown to prove only part of the offence the statute proves part of the case for the Crown.

# R v Oakes [1986] 1 SCR 103

**Facts:** Mr. Oakes was caught in possession of a large amount of weed oil. He was charged under the Narcotic Control act of possession with intent to traffic. The trial proceeded according to s.8 of the act which. S.8 states that once a person is found in possession of drugs they must prove that they did not intend to traffic. Mr. Oakes was found guilty of trafficking. Mr. Oakes brought a motion to challenge the constitutional validity of s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act, which he maintained imposes a burden on an accused to prove that he or she was not in possession for the purpose of trafficking. He argued that s. 8 violates the presumption of innocence contained in s. 11(d) of the Charter. Oakes won on appeal and the crown appealed.

**Issue:** Is s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act inconsistent with s. 11(d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms? If so, is it permissible under s.1 of the Charter?

**Rule:** Does s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act violate s. 11(d) of the Charter?; and (2) If it does, is s. 8 a reasonable limit prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society for the purpose of s. 1 of the Charter? If the answer to Q. 1 is affirmative and the answer to Q. 2 negative, then the constitutional question must be answered in the affirmative. S. 1 of the Charter states:

>The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.

**Analysis:** The meaning of a right or freedom guaranteed by the Charter is ascertained by an analysis of the purpose of such a guarantee. The purpose of s.11 is to ensure that, until the state proves an accused’s guilt beyond all reasonable doubt, he or she is innocent. The court found that Mr. Oakes is compelled by s. 8 to prove that he is not guilty of the offence of trafficking. He is thus denied his right to be presumed innocent and subjected to the potential penalty of life imprisonment unless he can rebut the presumption. Therefore, the act clearly contradicts s.11(d). To demonstrate acceptability under S.1 of the charter, the crown must prove that their objective is of sufficient importance and that the means imposed are reasonable and demonstrably justified. The court found that drug trafficking was significant enough of a social harm to meet the first test. The court found that the act failed on the second test. The act overly punished the possession of a small amount of narcotics and was therefore unreasonable and unfair. The act therefore violates both sections 1 and 11 of the charter.

**Conclusion:** Appeal dismissed. The act is of no force or effect.

# Actus Reus

Actus Reus, the criminal act, is the objective element of a crime. The actus reus is the actual thing forbidden by law, ex: killing. Actus reus does not consider the possible defences, ex: self-defence.

The main area of actus reus disputed in the law is the correct approach to **omissions.** There are three main ways an omission may be criminalized:

+ Not at all: In this framework, omissions cannot be criminalized, only positive acts.
+ Consequence based: In this framework, an omission is criminal only if it leads to certain result. Ex: criminal not save someone **only if** they die.
+ Legal imperative: An omission is criminal in this framework only if there is a law which states that in the given situation a person is required to act in a certain way.

Canadian law takes the third approach, the legal imperative. The only way a person is guilty of an offence in Canada is if their conduct breaks the law. Ex: Refusing to feed one's own children.

# R v Dunlop and Sylvester [1979] 2 SCR 881

This case is discussed briefly. The case established that failure to stop a crime is **not** considered an offence. Dunlop and Sylvester were present when a rape occurred and did nothing to intervene or obtain help. They were charged as accomplices to the rape. The supreme court reversed their convictions because there was no statute requiring them to intervene. The court gave an example to demonstrate the principle of Canadian law:

>The classic case is the hardened urbanite who stands around in a subway station when an individual is murdered.

# R v Moore [1979] 1 SCR 195

**Facts:** Moore was riding a bicycle in BC and ran a red light. Constable Sutherland, a peace officer with the Victoria City Police, in uniform and on a motorcycle, observed this infraction on the part of Moore and set about to “ticket” Moore. The constable and Moore proceeded side by side on their respective cycles, with Moore sometime taking elusive action by riding his bicycle on the sidewalk, with the constable repeatedly requesting Moore to “pull over and stop” and Moore lewdly rebuffing each such request with an obscene demand to leave him alone as he was in a hurry. The officer never arrested Moore in the initial encounter. Moore was thus charged with obstructing a peace officer in failing to stop. The trial judge concluded that Moore was not statute-bound to stop and therefore was not guilty. The BCCA reversed the trial judge's decision.

**Issue:** Is failing to stop and identify oneself for a peace officer considered 'obstruction' if the officer is required to obtain identification in the course of his duties?

**Rule:** A person is not required to stop and identify unless arrested or statute-bound to do so. A peace officer in BC is required to stop, identify, and ticket those who violate traffic law.

**Analysis:** The supreme court made it clear that Moore was not charged with failing to stop at a stop light, only with obstructing a peace officer in the performance of his duty. The obstruction which the Crown put forward as constituting the offence was the failure of the appellant to give his name when requested to do so by the police constable. Additionally, The obstruction which the Crown put forward as constituting the offence was the failure of the appellant to give his name when requested to do so by the police constable. The seminal case in Canada on 'stop and identify' is **Rice v Connolly.** In that case, a constable viewed a man acting "suspiciously" and asked him to identify. The man flatly refused. In Rice, the failure to identify was not considered obstruction. The majority distinguished the case from *Rice* by considering that the constable in that case was not duty-bound to stop and identify the individual. In the present case, it was the duty of the peace officer to ticket Moore. By refusing to identify himself, Moore stopped Sutherland from performing his duties. The court also analyzed the case based on a balancing of interests. Since it is not a major inconvenience to stop and identify, but it is a major inconvenience to police to have citizen's refuse to stop after committing an offence: the balanced view is to consider failure to stop as obstruction.

**Conclusion:** The court found that Moore's failure to stop and identify constituted obstruction. Appeal dismissed.

**Dissent:** Dickson and Estey JJ dissented. Dickson writing for the dissent.

**Rule:** The same as the majority.

**Analysis:** The duty to act is separate from the duties of police. Additionally, the balancing claim of the majority is moot since police have in this case the power to arrest. If the officer needed to identify Moore, he could have simply arrested him. Additionally, the principle set by allowing the appeal would undermine the basic right against self-incrimination. Since it is the duty of police to gather evidence, it could be argued based on the principle of the majority that even failure to **Confess** to a crime is obstruction. The Dissent would dismiss the appeal and restore the judgment at trial.

# Voluntariness

Voluntariness is the other branch of the actus reus. For an offence to be criminal it must be voluntary. A person can still be morally responsible for an act that was involuntary. Involuntariness asks whether the act was *caused* by an outside force.

# R v Daviault  [1994] 3 SCR 63

**Facts:** Daviault became heavily intoxicated after consuming over 40 drinks in a single day. He raped the complainant that night. D claims to have no knowledge of the events from that night. At trial, a doctor testified that D was too drunk to have had control over his actions. The "blackout" state was described by the doctor as a state in which all higher mental faculties are disabled. D was acquitted at trial due to failure of the crown to show voluntariness. The case was appealed and arrived at the supreme court.

**Issue:** Can a state of drunkenness which is so extreme that an accused is in a condition that closely resembles automatism or a disease of the mind as defined in s. 16 of the Criminal Code, constitute a basis for defending a crime which requires not a specific but only a general intent?

**Rule:** Specific intent requires a malicious or ulterior motive. General intent requires only an intent to commit the act itself. Sexual assault requires general intent.

**Analysis:** General intent offences as a rule are those which require the minimal intent to do the act which constitutes the actus reus. 
Proof of intent is usually inferred from the commission of the act on the basis of the principle that a person in-tends the natural consequences of his or her act. Drunkenness therefore, serves as no defence against a general intent offence such as sexual assault.

**Conclusion:** Daviault was found guilty of sexual assault.

# R v Wolfe  (1974) CCC (2d) 382 (Ont CA)

**Facts:** The appellant is a part-owner of a hotel in Kingston. On previous occasions, the complainant had been told, for good reason, that he was not to enter the hotel premises. On the evening in question, despite that prohibition, he entered the hotel. The appellant, using discretion and restraint, ordered him to leave. The complainant would not leave. The appellant then went to the telephone and while he was calling the police for the purpose of having him removed, the complainant punched the appellant who turned quickly and hit the complainant on the head with the telephone receiver. 
The complainant had a rather serious cut to his fore-head, but that was really all that happened. Wolfe was found guilty of assault. Wolfe appealed the conviction.

**Issue:** Is a person who hits another considered responsible if the situation demonstrates that the act was not malicious?

**Rule:** A minimal level of intent is required for a conviction of assault causing bodily harm.

**Analysis:** The court of appeal based there decision on that fact that the trial judge indicated that Wolfe's blow was reflexive. 

>If, as it would seem to us, the trial Judge regarded the action by the accused as being the result of a reflex action then no offence was committed because some intent is a necessary ingredient in an assault occasioning bodily harm.

**Conclusion:** Appeal allowed. Wolf is acquitted of the assault.

# De Minimis

The principle of *de minimis* is that crimes should not be punished if they are extremely minor. More specifically, some use the principle to argue that the law should not be strictly applied in instances where the offence was technically committed but has a very minor impact on the public interest. 

# R v Kubassek  (2004) 189 OAC 339 (Ont CA)

**Facts:** After the legalization of gay marriage in Canada, Reverand Hark held gay weddings in his church. Erica Kubassek holds very strong views about same-sex marriages. She considers such marriages to be a falling away from God’s truth. She believes herself to be a Christian servant of the Lord, endowed with the spiritual gifts of revelation and prophesy. K believed that God commanded her to attend Hark's service and preach about the evils of homosexuality. K interrupted one of Hark's services. When Hark attempted to convince K to settle down she pushed him away. Hark stumbled backwards but suffered no injuries. K was charged with assault. The trial judge and court of appeal agreed that her assault was too minor and therefore acquitted her.

**Issue:** Does assault which fails to cause any injury or threaten the victim satisfy the test for *de minis?*

**Rule:** If a crime too minor it is no matter for the law. This common law defence is not established in Canada, this case did not define whether it should become part of Canadian law.

**Analysis:** The court discussed the maxim and its status in Canadian law. The de minimis defence is not established and the court chose not to address it in this case. Instead, the court discussed whether the crime in question could be considered minor. The court found that the crime was not minor as K's actions caused a major disturbance. 

**Conclusion:** K was convicted but absolutely discharged. The crime therefore rose to the level of criminal behaviour but did not justify punishment.

# Causation

In some cases, the criminal law punishes an act that results in a certain outcome. Manslaughter is the quintessential case. In manslaughter, the punishment is much harsher than assault even if the act itself was no worse than a similar act that did not lead to death.

# Smithers v The Queen   [1978] 1 SCR 506

**Facts:** The appellant (A) kicked a player (Cobby) from an opposing hockey team which probably resulted in his death. During the hockey game, Cobby yelled racial slurs and profanities at A. The two continued in a heated verbal exchange throughout the game. A made threats against Cobby and challenged him to a fight after the game. Cobby attempted to escape quickly after the game.
A followed Cobby in the parking lot and punched him. When Cobby bent over from the blow, A kicked him in the stomach.
Cobby fell to the ground and died minutes later. At trial, A was found guilty of manslaughter.
A argues that Cobby could have died as a result of causes outside A's control. A appealed.

**Issue:** To what extent must the crown disprove alternative theories in a cause-based offence?

**Rule:** A person is considered to have caused a death even if other factors contributed to the death.

**Analysis:** The court agreed that it was possible that Cobby died as result of factors other than the kick. Cobby's death was in fact caused by chocking on his own vomit. At trial, a medical expert testified that heightened fear or random chance can prevent the natural course of human response to vomiting which prevents suffocation. The court dismissed the contention that a mere possibility defeats the charge. The jury was able to hear all available evidence including the testimony of medical experts in making their decision. Additionally, even if Cobby's death was caused by a heightened sense of fear or random chance, A is still guilty. Cobby's heightened fear or a predisposition to choke would not have killed Cobby had it not been for the kick.

>An accused is not freed from responsibility for culpable homicide only if death might have been prevented had the proper means been used to treat the injury caused by the accused.

**Conclusion:** Appeal dismissed. A is guilty of manslaughter.

# Causation

Smithers/net test rules: Whether the person would have died but for the the actions of the accused AND the cause is outside the de minimis range.

Tools to use in the Smithers/net test: reasonable forseeability, intervening actions tool.

CCC: 224, 225, 226


# overview

The crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt:

+ The act occured in their jurisdiction
+ The act was done by the accused
+ The actus reus
+ The mens rea


# Regulatory offences

There are some regulatory schemes (generally provincial) which impose more or less serious penalties for failure to comply. Often, the legislation enabling these schemes make it very hard to get away with the prohibited act. In order to make the scheme enforceable, the legislature will often create an **absolute liability offence** or a **strict liability offence.** These types of offences are easier to make out against an accused which streamlines the regulatory process. These offences also deny the accused the normal presumption of innocence to some degree. Such offences are defended as necessary for the proper regulation of industry in the interest of the public. The offences are also defended because the penalties are generally not very serious.

| Type | Absolute Liability | Strict Liability | Typical Mens Rea |
|:----:|:----:|:----:|:---:|
| **Description** | Once the actus reus is made out, the defendant is guilty | The defendant is guilty if they cannot prove on a balance of probabilities that they exercised due care | The defendant is guilty if the prosecution can show that the defendant had a guilty mind |
| **Benefit to:** | Prosecution | Prosecution | Defence |
| **Related Terms** | Objective fault offence. Public welfare offence. | Halfway-house. | True criminal offence. Subjective fault offence. |

# R v Sault Ste. Marie [1978] 2 SCR 1299

**Facts:** The City of Sault Ste. Marie (the city) hired a contractor to dispose of the city's garbage. The contractor built a dump near a river. Eventually, rainwater carried pollutants from the dump to the river. The city was charged that it did discharge, or cause to be discharged, or permitted to be discharged, or deposited materials into Cannon Creek and Root River contrary to s. 32(1) of the Ontario Water Resources Commission Act. The city was convicted as the charge is an absolute offence. The city argued that they should not be liable as they did nothing wrong; all damage was done by the contractor. The city and Crown then engaged in a series of complicated appeals and cross-appeals in different courts before the case made it to the supreme court.

**Issues:** Whether s. 32(1) is duplicituous and/or invalid criminal law. Whether the city broke the law.

**Rule:** The test for duplicity is whether the defendant knows his case to meet based on the charge. Not all laws with a penalty are necessarily criminal law. S. 32(1) is not criminal law, it is administrative (regulatory) law. Administrative law can have a validly lower standard for proof.

**Analysis:** The court considered whether the charge was duplicitous and answered in the negative. The court the type of offence in question. The court created several categories for interpreting law:

+ Offences in which mens rea, consisting of some positive state of mind such as intent, knowledge, or recklessness, must be proved by the prosecution either as an inference from the nature of the act committed, or by additional evidence.
+ Offences in which there is no necessity for the prosecution to prove the existence of mens rea; the doing of the prohibited act prima facie imports the offence, leaving it open to the accused to avoid liability by proving that he took all reasonable care. This involves consideration of what a reasonable man would have done in the circumstances. The defence will be available if the accused reasonably believed in a mistaken set of facts which, if true, would render the act or omission innocent, or if he took all reasonable steps to avoid the particular event.
+ Offences of absolute liability where it is not open to the accused to exculpate himself by showing that he was free of fault.

The court then defined that all "true criminal law" falls under the first category. Public welfare offences (regulatory law) prima facie falls under the second category but may fall under the third. The regulation in question must explicitly include language putting it in the third category (absolute liability) for the court to consider it as such. S. 32(1) does not have such language and neither does it have language bringing in subjective fault (ex: willingly). The section is provincial law and therefore not criminal law. s. 32(1) therefore falls under the second category. The court does not have the facts to consider whether the defendant is guilty as this defence did not exist at trial.

**Conclusion:** New trial ordered. This case determined that it is acceptable for the blame to shift to the accused when the offence in question is not "true criminal law." In these cases, the defendant must show an balance of probabilities that they reasonably believed something which if true would render their actions innocent. This new "middle ground" interpretation of fault is justified by administrative convenience and public interest. By removing loopholes, those who would commit an offence have reason to assure that they take every precaution. Additionally, by reducing the burden of proof, these minor charges are litigated faster.

# Reference Re Section 94(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act, BC [1985] 2 SCR 486

**Facts:** s. 94(2) (the section) of the BC Motor Vehicle Act (the act) states that anyone driving without a license is guilty of an offence. The offence requires a minimum jail sentence of 7 days. The act was challenged on charter grounds. The plaintiffs submitted that the absolute offence offends the principles of fundamental justice and violates Charter 7 and 11(d) rights. The law was struck down by the BC courts. The AG of BC appealed to the supreme court.

**Issues:** Does the section violate s. 7 and/or 11(d) rights? If so, is it justified under s. 1 of the charter?

**Rule:** Principles of fundamental justice (PFJ) require that the prosecution bears the burden of proof. Absolute liability offences therefore always violate PFJ and the charter. Absolute liability (or strict liability) offences can only be justified under s.1: reasonably justifiable in a free and democratic society.

**Analysis:** The section violates PFJ and *at least* s. 7 of the charter. The AG of BC fails to justify the absolute liability offence on the basis of expediency. Creating the offence as strict liability (2nd category in *Ste. Marie*) would be just as expedient. The section is therefore not reasonable; it goes too far.

**Conclusion:** The section cannot be justified under s. 1 of the charter. The section is invalid law. Appeal dismissed.

# R v Chapin  [1979] 2 SCR 121

**Facts:** Mrs. Loise Chapin was duck-hunting on private land with a friend. A conservation officer heard the shots and came to investigate. Some 50 yards from where Chapin was shooting, the officer found a small pile of grain. s. 14 of the Ontario Migratory Birds Regulations (the section) states that it is an offence to shoot birds within a quarter mile of bait. Chapin was charged under the section. It was generally accepted at trial that Chapin did not know that the bait was there. The trial court held that the offence was one of absolute liability and Chapin was therefore guilty. Chapin appealed, basically submitting the ridiculousness of the charge. Appeals court overturned, stating that there was a mens rea requirement.

**Issue:** Does the section create an absolute liability offence? Can the absolute liability offence be upheld?

**Rule:** Judges should consider mens rea when an offence includes terms like "wilfully" or "intent." Something may be characterized as a public welfare offence when it concerns public welfare and is part of a regulatory (not criminal) scheme. Public welfare offences are prima facie strict liability (per *Ste. Marie*). Regulations must be read to include the reasonable intentions of their authors.

**Analysis:** The section does not use words tending to include mens rea. The section creates an offence which protects the public interest in keeping birds alive and it is part of a regulatory scheme. The section does not contain wording explicitly creating an absolute liability offence. The offence is therefore one of strict liability. The regulatory scheme read together indicates an intention to stop hunters from baiting and then shooting large numbers of birds (not giving fair chase). If Chapin was negligent in not searching the area for bait, then a hunter is required to search every inch of a half-mile diameter around theme before shooting. The court reasoned that the intentions of the regulators cannot possibly have been to create an offence under which Chapin's actions were negligent. 

**Conclusion:** Appeal dismissed. Respondent (Chapin) awarded costs.

# R v London Excavators & Trucking Ltd  (1998) 40 OR (3d) 32 (CA)

**Facts:** The general contractor *Cooper* hired London Excavators (London) to excavate an area of a construction site. The Cooper supervisor instructed the London operator, Carpanzano, to excavate in a certain area. Carpanzano hit concrete and alerted his foreman, Carelli. Moores, another Cooper employee, instructed Carelli and Carpanzano that the concrete was nothing to worry about and to keep digging. Both London employees had worked with Cooper's employees before and trusted their advice. Carpanzano continued excavating which caused an explosion. The concrete turned out to be part of a service which Cooper failed to locate beforehand. Despite not having a locate done on the area, site plans actually showed the service which Moores misidentified. London was convicted with failing to follow safety procedures according to Ontario regulations. London appealed, arguing that they were not negligent as it was reasonable to trust Moores.

**Issue:** Was the London employees belief reasonable enough to satisfy due diligence?

**Rule:** An accused may prove themselves not guilty of strict liability offence by showing that they had a reasonable (but mistaken) belief in a fact (or set of facts) which if true would mean the act was not an offence.

**Analysis:** It is clear that the London employees had a good-faith belief that there were no services in the digging area. If there had been no services in the area, London would not have caused an explosion and therefore would be innocent. The question the court had to consider was whether London's belief was reasonable. The court found that *at least* once Carpanzano hit concrete, the belief that there were no services was not reasonable. Cooper employees were wrong once, about the existence of the concrete, which should have prompted further investigation before continuing to dig. Additionally, the proper locates were not done on the dig site. London's belief was therefore unreasonable.

**Conclusion:** London held liable for failing to comply with regulations. Appeal dismissed.

>"Even though the appellant held the honest subjective belief that Cooper’s supervisors had access to accurate locate information and had accurately imparted that information, the defence of mistake of fact was not established because it was not objectively reasonable"

# Penal Negligence

Penal negligence offences are offences for which the actus reus necessarily includes a failure to take some action. Obviously, the Crown has difficulty proving a subjective mens rea in these cases. How can one prove, for example, that when B left the house he **intended** to neglect his baby such that the baby died. Many of these offences are therefore considered objectively.

One way of considering fault objectively is through an absolute liability offence. A Crown need only prove that the prohibited thing was done or not done to prove an absolute offence. A strict liability offence is similar but the defendant is allowed to prove (BOP) that they were not negligent. 

## Hundal 1993

This case set the standard for dangerous driving. The accused drove a dump truck overfilled. The accused blew a red light and T-boned a car, killing the driver instantly. The case went to the SCC. The SCC had to decide if the test for intent was objective or subjective, they crated a modified objective test. The Crown must prove the actus reus and mens rea.

+ Actus reus: is the driving objectively dangerous
+ Mensu rea: the degree of departure from the standard. Must be a marked departure.

This was justified based on:

+ Licensing requirement: all drivers are presumptively capable
+ Automatic and reflexive nature of driving: subjective intent impossible to prove
+ Wording of the section: indicates that the statute deals with the "manner" of driving.
+ Stats: Too many driving deaths.

## R v Beatty 2008 SCC 5

**Facts:** Justin Beatty drove around the 90 km/h speed limit on a BC highway. Beatty lost attention for an instant. During his inattention, Beatty slid around 1.5 feet over the centre line on a bend in the road. Beatty's truck struck a smaller vehicle. All three occupants of the other car died. Beatty told a paramedic at the time that he probably had heat stroke but later claimed he had no specific memories of the event. Beatty was driving normally for a long period of time up until right before the accident. For all intents and purposes, it seems to have been a freak accident. The trial judge acquitted on the basis that momentary inattention is not a marked departure. The BCCA ordered a new trial. Beatty appealed to the SCC

**Issue:** Who bears the burden of proof in a penal negligence offence, specifically, dangerous driving.

**Rule:** The marked departure test has two steps:

+ Was the driving objectively dangerous
+ Was the driving a marked departure from the standard of a reasonably prudent driver.

**Analysis:** The supreme court found that the BCCA was in error to stop at the actus reus portion of the marked departure analysis. Though the driving was objectively dangerous, the Crown's burden was far from discharged. The court noted that having established the actus reus, the standard for civil negligence is met. The analysis must then turn to whether the dangerous driving was a marked departure. The Crown must show that the accused markedly departed. It was not the defendant's duty to prove non-negligence. Non-negligence might however, be used as a defence once the two previous elements are proven by the Crown.

**Conclusion:** Appeal allowed. Acquittal restored.

## R. v. DeSousa

**Facts:** Ms. Santos attended a party in Ontario. A fight broke out between DeSousa and another man. Santos began grabbing her belongings to leave the area of the fight. Before she could get out of the room, DeSousa threw a bottle which hit the wall, shattered, and injured Santos' arm. Desousa was charged with unlawfully causing bodily harm.

**Issue:** What mental element is necessary for the predicate offence to make out a penal negligence offence with a predicate offence. Does the offence in question violate Charter s.7 rights (violate PFJ).

**Rule:** Unlawful means against federal or provincial law. This predicate offence must be in itself likely to injure another person. The victim must be actually injured.

**Analysis:** English courts held that to make out a charge of manslaughter the Crown must prove that the unlawful act (predicate) was likely to injure another person. The court substantially adopted this view. The court rejected the contention that such offences punish the innocent. Rather, these offences are aimed at prevent objectively dangerous acts. Additionally, the court rejected the view that any criminal charge suffices as a valid predicate. Only an act that **is** objectively dangerous can be the predicate.

**Conclusion:** Appeal dismissed. Conviction upheld.



# Assault

Assault is a broad category of offences. Assault, in general, is the touching or application of force to a person without that person's consent. In some instances, common law and statutes vitiate consent to some forms of touching or application of force. For example, a person cannot consent to being killed and a child cannot consent to sex. In cases of killing or sexual assault to a minor then, it would do no good to the defendant to show consent (in terms of the actus reus of assault).

## R v Dewey 1999 ABCA 5

**Facts:** The complainant was fighting a third person in a bar. Michael Dewey (D) got between the complainant and the other man. D forcefully shoved the complainant which caused him to fall and hit his head. D was charged with assault causing bodily harm. D was convicted at trial. D appealed, arguing that the judged erred in failing to consider whether it was reasonably foreseeable that the injury would occur.

**Issue:** Does the *DeSousa* decision's rationale apply to assault; does the resulting injury have to be foreseeable for the predicate assault to form the basis of assault causing bodily harm?

**Rule:** The DeSousa principle is that the predicate offence must reasonably be seen as dangerous (in terms of possibly causing bodily harm). The DeSousa decision relates only direct to the charge of "unlawfully causing bodily harm." The court extended this reasoning to assault.

**Analysis:** The court found that D's position on the relevant question was too broad. D argued that the relevant question was whether it was foreseeable that the shove would cause the complainant to hit his head on the jukebox. The court found that the actual question was whether forcefully shoving someone in a bar foreseeable creates a risk of bodily harm which is neither trivial nor transitory. The trial judge found (as a fact) that D shoved the complainant with more force than would cause a stumble. Even if the judge erred in law, this finding of fact would lead to guilt under the test above.

**Conclusion:** The trial judge's decision would not be changed by applying the rule in DeSousa. Appeal dismissed, conviction upheld.

## R v Jobidon [1991] 2 SCR 714

**Facts:** Jobidon (J) was at a hotel bar at the same time as Haggart (H). H approached J to challenge him to a fight. H was larger than J and had training as a boxer. H had the upper hand in this initial encounter according to the trial judge. The two men were ejected from the bar and continued their fight outside. At this point, it was clear that both men were consenting to a "fair" fist fight. The tables turned in this second fight. J managed to punch H in the face, knocking him onto the hood of a car. J believed that H was stunned at this point, but still capable of fighting. As H bounced off the hood, J landed several more blows to the head. H was, in fact, unconscious when he hit the hood of the car. The subsequent blows killed H. J was found not guilty of manslaughter as it was clear that H consented to the fight. The OCA reversed. J appealed.

**Issue:** Whether a person can validly consent to being hit in a fist-fight. Whether the Crown must always prove absence of consent, or whether common-law principles can vitiate consent in certain situations including fist-fights.

**Rule:** A person cannot consent to a fist-fight. An assault charge may be made out where both parties consent to a fight.

**Analysis:** The common law of England long held that fist-fights can not be consented to. The Canadian law is somewhat more muddled. The CCC states that it does not override the common law (s.8). The appellant argues that since the CCC limits consent in cases of sexual assault (ss. 150.1 159) and consent to abduction (s. 286) the CCC's limitations on consent must be seen as exhaustive. The court rejected by reductio: if the list were exhaustive, then a father who puts a scarf on his daughter without her consent has committed assault. Clearly, common law principles of interpretation must apply to assault.

The court then turned to considering whether the common law vitiated consent in this case. The majority of combined English-Canadian case law holds that one cannot consent to a fist-fight. It is preferable from a policy perspective to hold that one cannot consent to fist fights. If people were allowed to consent to such things, people might lose their inhibitions towards violence. Additionally, fights of this kind are not compatible with current Canadian values of personal dignity and bodily integrity. The common law therefore does, and should, vitiate consent to fist-fights.

**Conclusion:** Appeal dismissed. Conviction of the OCA upheld.

**Concurrence:** Sopinka and Stevenson concurred in result only. They argued that the non-consent element of the actus reus cannot be removed. Instead, they argue that H did not consent to the blows delivered after he was unconscious.

## R v McSorley 2000 BCPC 116

**Facts:** At a Boston v Vancouver hockey game McSorely (M), a Boston player, slashed Brashear (B), a Vancouver player, with his stick. The game was frustrating for the Bruins who were losing 4-0 by the final seconds of the game. M was the Bruins "enforcer." He was tasked with being rough for the purpose of morale by his coach. M and B had fought near the beginning of the game. In the initial fight, B knocked M to the ground and then proceeded to antagonize the Bruins players. By the end of the game the Bruins were losing morale. The coach put M on the ice with around 20 seconds left to finish the fight with B and restore some morale. B apparently knew what was going on and avoided M. M pursued B and slashed him in the head with his stick from behind. B hit the ground and suffered a concussion and seizure. M was charged with assault.

**Issue:** How far does the implicit consent to rough-housing in sports extend.

**Rule:** It is trite law that those who play sports consent to some level of injury. The judge applied a test as follows:

+ Is there a valid benefit to society in the action consented to?
+ Did the impugned act occur within the commonly understood limits of injury allowed by the game's unwritten rules?
+ If not, did the defendant intend only to injury within the boundaries of the unwritten rules?
+ If not then the defendant committed assault as there was no consent.

**Analysis:** It was common ground of both parties that the slash would be assault if it were done intentionally. The unwritten rules of hockey do not allow for slashes to the head. The impugned action clearly violated the rules to which B had consented. M argued that he was aiming for B's shoulder, but missed and hit B in the head. The policy consideration which underrides the vitiation of consent in *Jobidon* is that the activity has no value to society. The only value to society in M's actions would have been the boost to Bruin's morale. This justification is not enough even to justify a slash to the shoulder. On this point alone, assault would be made out. Continuing, the judged asked as a matter of fact whether the hit was intended for the shoulder or head. The judge found that M did in fact aim for and hit B in the head.

**Conclusion:** B did not consent to being slashed in the head. M is guilty of assault.

>"He had an impulse to strike him in the head. His mindset, always tuned to aggression, permitted that. He slashed for the head. A child, swinging as at a Tee ball, would not miss. A housekeeper swinging a carpetbeater would not miss. An NHL player would never, ever miss. 
Brashear was struck as intended. 
>
> Mr. McSorley, I must find you guilty as charged."

## R v Javanmardi (2019) SCC 54

**Facts:** M and his wife went to Javanmardi (J) to seek alternative medical treatment. M received a 1 hour consult from J. J explained that a "nutrient injection" would be the best course of treatment. J had administered these injections regularly for years. M demanded the treatment immediately and J complied. J injected the concoction which killed M by the end of the day. J was fully certified as a naturopath. The components of the nutrient mix were properly stored and bought from a licensed Ontario pharmacy. There was bacteria in the mix because of an error upstream from J. J was not allowed by Quebec law to administer the injections. J was charged with criminal negligence and manslaughter. The trial judge found that because of her education and the care taken, J's actions were not a marked departure and she was acquitted. The appeals court reversed and entered convictions.

**Issue:** Whether a person's education can for the basis of the modified objective test. Whether a certain act can be objectively dangerous regardless of the circumstances.

**Rule:** A judge may consider education where it is directly relevant to the act itself. This includes situations where a reasonable person would not perform the act *unless* they had the proper education. The circumstances must be considered to form the mens rea of the offence.

**Analysis:** The actus reus of unlawful act manslaughter does not require an independent objective dangerousness analysis.
The Crown does not have to show that the act is objectively dangerous to make out the mens rea in either of these charges.
Both offences require a measurement against the objective standard. This standard requires considering the circumstances of the activity. The analysis of the **activity** can take education and experience into consideration.

**Conclusion:** Acquittals restored.
