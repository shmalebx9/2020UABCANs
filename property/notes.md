To determine what a land granted or sold actually contains is difficult. A paper description is more or less ambiguous, to determine what the boundaries of land actually are there are three principles listed in descending priority.

+ Natural boundaries
+ Lines and corners actually marked
+ references to adjacent lands



# Blewman v Wilkinson [1979] 2 NZLR 208 (CA)

Wilkinson owned a large plot of land. He hired contractors and surveyors to subdivide his land. In the course of the earthworks a hill was partially excavated. After several years, Blewman purchased land near the partially excavated hill. The hill eroded further, causing damage which could have been anticipated to Blewman's home. Normally, a firm is strictly liable for damage done to adjacent property by changing the natural form of the land.

Issue: Whether a firm can be strictly liable for modifications to land completed when that firm owned the land in question.

The judge held that the firm is not strictly liable. The land was purchased as it was with the structural issues described and so it would be unjust to extend liability meant to protect the degradation of previously valuable property.

# R v Nikal [1996] 1 SCR 1013

The applant (Nikal) was fishing without a license on a BC reserve. He appealed his conviction based on the fact that the river in question flowed directly through the reserve and was therefore band property. Additionally, the constitution act 1865 allows indigenous people to hunt/fish/trap freely.

The court ruled that the English common law of ad medium felum aquae does not apply in Canada since it is not suited to local conditions. In Canada, a river is considered crown land (highway) if it is navigable, the river was navigable and thus crown land. The band cannot make laws pertaining to crown land.

The court found in favour of the plaintiff on the constitutional claim and he was acquitted.

# The Land Title System

Originally, the common law conveyances system governed England and the empire. Under the Conveyance system, land owners looking to sell their land were required to produce documentary evidence of legitimate ownership. It was incumbent on the purchaser to look over the seller's documents to determine if the land really belonged to the supposed seller. In this system, purchasers risked losing their claims if another person with a legitimate claim to the land came forward.

The land title system originated in Australia and allowed property owners to register a title with the government. In the title system, the owner of the title is always the indefeasible owner of the land which reduces risks and ambiguity for purchasers.

In general, a conveyance system protects established interests whereas a title system protects buyers. When A Sells land to B:

| Conveyance | Immediate Indefeasiblility | Deferred Indefeasibility |
|:----:|:----:|:----:| 
| B's claim to the land can be challenged at any time | B's owns the land immediately and permanently | B owns the land as long as no one else comes forward to challenge A's previous ownership |

## CIBC v. Rockway Holdings Ltd. (1996), 7 O.T.C. 210 (GD)

A property owner granted an exclusive licence to remove all gravel from its property. A year and a half later, the owner's bank registered a lien on the property to secure a loan. A year and a half after the bank had registered its lien, the licensee registered the licence agreement. The bank applied for a declaration that its charge had priority over the licence agreement. The licensee asserted that its charge had priority, where the bank had actual notice of the licence agreement.


The Ontario Court (General Division), in a decision reported 5 O.T.C. 69, dismissed the application, holding that the bank had actual notice and the licence had priority. The licensee and owner thereafter sought solicitor and client costs because of an offer to settle.


The Ontario Court (General Division) declined to award solicitor and client costs.

## Lawrence v Wright, 2007 ONCA 74

**Facts:** Susan Lawrence was the owner of the property. An imposter, acting as Lawrence, pretended to sell her house to a fraudster, Thomas Wright. Wright obtained a mortgage with CIBC who paid out the cost of the house to the imposter. Wright and the imposter disappeared leaving CIBC as the registered owner of the title to the property. CIBC claims ownership via immediate indefeasibility, Lawrence claims ownership under deferred indefeasibility.

**Issue:** Whether a buyer, acting in good faith, is entitled to land purchased through fraud.

**Rule:** The Ontario statute was unclear, supporting either an interpretation immediate indefeasibility or deferred. The judge concluded that the statute is rightly interpreted as advancing deferred indefeasibility.

**Analysis:** The judge concluded that the Ontario Legislation supported deferred indefeasibility. This means that property belongs to the owner of the title unless it was obtained through fraud. Unlike a strict common law system, a claim to land is only enforceable through **one** sale alone (hence deferred). If A sells to B, through fraud, but B sells to C who buys in good faith, then the title belongs to C even though it did not properly belong to C. This system allows the title system to be a reliable guide to the real owner of land without totally jeopardizing existing land claims. Since CIBC is the immediate, not deferred owner, there land title claim is void.

**Conclusion:** Susan Lawrence is the valid owner of the title to the property.

# Types of Ownership Systems

## Individual Title Searches: The buyer must investigate to make sure the seller really owns the land.

This system is difficult for buyers. A buyer may be mistaken about a sale decades prior and be deprived of the land they bought in good faith.

## Deeds Registration (US): Deeds can be entered into a government document store. The deeds are not verified by the government, only stored. The registry provides no guarantees and is not compulsory.

The priority in claims in a deeds system can be different. Priority matters when two mortgages are taken against the same property and the owner defaults. 

+ In a race system the first bank to register the deed has priority
+ In a notice system the deed registration is only one way of giving notice
+ In a race-notice system the second bank can have priority provided it is registered first and was given no notice by the first bank

## Torrens System (Title Registration): The registered title owner is the owner.

Mirror principle: The title mirrors the legal truth
Curtain principle: A curtain falls over the past once title is transferred. Nothing in the past matters to current and future owners.

Most jurisdictions make an exception for cases of fraud. 

deferred indefeasibility: Owner (real owner) > Fraudster (not an owner) > good faith buyer (not an owner) > good faith buyer (real owner). Under DI, as long as you don't "touch" the fraud you are a real owner regardless of past fraud. 

The courts in Alberta are liberal in applying the fraud principle and thus have a low standard of evidence for showing fraud in land transfers.

# Edwards v Sims

A cave in kentucky was discovered near mammoth cave. Most of the cave was under Edward's land. About a third of the cave was under the neighbour Paley's land. Paley sought to have the cave surveyed. L. P. Edwards was a show-cave businessman who ran the onyx cave. The only entrance was on Edward's land.

**Rule:** Owner of the land owns everything above and everything below. Exceptions for air travel.

**Dissent:** Logan held that Edward's owned the whole cave because he discovered, developed, and marketed it.

# Mixing Materials in Roman law

When money is mixed, they are the same and so can be separated again easily: doesn't matter if everyone gets the same bills they put in

When other materials are mixed such that they are destroyed the legal question is also simple: Wheat and oil in a mixture are useless to all and no one claims it.

When things are of the same nature and are mixed the question is also easy: In Glencore, oil was wrongfully added from one firm to that of another, the plaintiff was simply given from the mixture they same weight as they put in.

Accessio principle: Whoever owns the capital owns the interest, whoever owns the cow owns the calf. This also works in the opposite direction: owner of the machine owns its parts.

# Glencore International AG v Metro Trading, 2001

**Facts:** MTI was engaged in the business of buying, blending and selling fuel oil. It bought fuel oil of various grades and other oil products from a variety of sources which it stored temporarily and then re-sold, after carrying out any necessary blending.  MTI bought oil from Glencore and various other companies and this oil was blended and refined. MTI went bankrupt and the various companies which had stored oil with MTI wanted their oil returned.

**Issue:** How can property that has been mixed by redistributed if it is processed into another product.

**Rule:** Indian Oil v. Greenstone rule states that when property of two owners is mixed, the mixture is held in common.

**Analysis:** The judge simply extended the Indian Oil rule. The processed oil was held to be a common chattel to the companies which had sold crude to MTI.

**Conclusion:** Goods held in common.

# Estates

**Background:** Estates are a specific common-law understanding of land right which come from English feudalism. Under feudalism, only the Crown really "owns" land. Those who have the rights to use the land have an estate in the land which they can trade and use dependent on its type. Estates can thus be seen as rights to time + land. The types of estates are:

+ Fee simple: basically identical to land ownership. The person with a fee simple can sell or change the land as they see fit.
+ Entailed interest: the land can be used by the lineal descendants of the grantor but they cannot sell the land. This ensures the land stays in the family forever. **This type is gone in Canada.**
+ Life interest: The grantee has full use of the land for their lifetime. If A sells the land to B, B can keep it only so long as A is still alive.

**Waste:** The doctrine of waste serves to protect future estate-holders. If an estate subsists with one individual for a time, they may be liable to keep it in good order for the next owner. There are three types of waste:

+ Ameliorating: a change to the land which increases its value. Courts generally do not punish tenants for this kind of waste.
+ Permissive: a change to the land which occurs as the result of a failure to act (ex: never mowing, not fixing a leak). Courts will punish this type of wast to some extent.
+ Voluntary: a change to the land which decreases its value and which is done on purpose. The courts are most severe with this type of waste for obvious reasons.

## RC Ellickson, "Property in Land"

The author seems to be arguing against a common point of view in critical legal circles but he doesn't spell it out. The argument he seems to be going after is presumably as follows:

>Permanent land rights such as a fee simple are an oppressive western concept emanating from backwards feudal ideas. Instead, land rights should be held in common, by the worthy, or distributed by some other more inclusive means.

The author then explains via economic analysis why this view is wrong-headed. Fee-simple estates force the current land-holder to consider the land's future value for eternity. If Roger owns lot C then Roger has as much wealth as is contained in his other assets + the total market value of lot C. If Roger devalues the land by overusing it or otherwise destroying it, he becomes less wealthy. Roger therefore has an interest in making sure the land is usable in the future. If land were given according to need or ability or some other means, this incentive would not exists. In that case, people would have an incentive to extract as much value from the land as possible while they maintained their temporary rights over it.

## Thomas v Murphy (1990), 107 NBR (2d) 165

**Facts:** The plaintiffs hired the defendant to purchase land on their behalf. The defendant did so by purchasing land from the estate of Reuben McLeod. Mcleod's will gave the executors of his estate the power to sell the property with the following wording

>"...to the Grantees as Executors and Trustees of [the estate] so that they may give a good and sufficient deed thereof to any purchaser."

Unfortunately, the wording necessary to grant a fee simple is "to X and their heirs." The plaintiffs discovered this error and realized that they did not have legitimate title to the property. The plaintiffs sued for the cost of repairing their title.

**Issue:** Is the wording in McLeod's will sufficient to grant a fee simple?

**Rule:** The words "and his/her heirs" must be used to grant a fee simple. The courts should try to interpret the actual intent of a document's author.

**Analysis:** The will is extremely clear in its intent. The exists to give all the rights over the property to the executors. Therefore, it can be established that the executors have the right to sell the estate as fee-simple. The plaintiffs have legitimate title to the land.

**Conclusion:** The plaintiffs have no cause for action as they have title. Action dismissed.

## Re Walker (1924), 56 OLR 517 (CA)

**Facts:** John Walker died. His will stated that his estate should go to his wife but that if any remained after she did then it would go to other individuals. When the widow died, those named in the husband's will try to claim from the widow's estate. The widow's estate argued that the estate had been given absolutely. At trial, the judge sided with those claiming under the husband.

**Issue:** Whether an estate can be given both wholly and conditionally.

**Rule:** When two pieces of a will cannot co-exist (one is repugnant to the law) then the one that is more central to the author's intentions should be paramount. A fee simple cannot be given conditionally.

**Analysis:** The court found that it must have been Walker's intention that on his death:

+ The entire estate be given in fee simple to his wife
+ When his wife died, the remainder go to X

This desire cannot be given legal force. An estate in fee simple cannot be alienated by some later event. The judge then reasoned that there were two possibilities:

+ The estate was given to the wife in fee simple and the gift over fails as repugnant.
+ The estate was given to the wife in life estate and now belongs to the other named parties.

The court found that the wording made it extremely clear that the estate was being given absolutely to the wife. Accordingly, the gift over is repugnant.

**Conclusion:** Appeal allowed. The husband's will has no claim over the wife's.

## Re Taylor (1982), 12 ETR 177

**Facts:** John Taylor's will read:

> "...Bequeath [my estate] to my wife Kathleen to have and use during her lifetime. Any estate of which she may be possessed at the time of her death is to be divided equally between my daughters."

When Mrs. Taylor died, her estate sought clarification on whether the funds from her husband would form part of her estate as in *Re Walker.*

**Issue:** Whether the will grants the a life interest in the estate or an absolute interest.

**Rule:** Where an estate is given with clear and explicit reference to the lifetime of the grantee, it is a life interest.

**Analysis:** The counsel argued that the Mrs. Taylor's estate must be absolute as in *Re Walker.* The court considered that Mrs. Taylor had something similar to absolute interest as she was free to deplete the estate as much as she wanted. The court found that Mrs. Taylor had a life interest with the power to encroach on capital (up to total depletion). The power to encroach is part of an absolute interest but it does not require one. 

**Conclusion:** Mrs. Taylor is quite clearly not the holder of the estate of her husband after her death.

## Christensen v Martini Estate

**Facts:** Mr. Martini's will specified that his wife would get his duplex and Susan Christensen would get all of his money. The will went on to say that once Mrs. Martini no longer "needed" the property she would give it to Sonya and Susan Christensen. The trial judge found that this section was too ambiguous to give any title to Mrs. Martini and therefore the property belonged to the Christensen's. Mrs. Martini appealed.

**Issue:** What type of interest does Mrs. Martini have in the property.

**Rule:** Wills are interpreted according to the reasonable intentions of the author. 

**Analysis:** The court outlined four possible definitions of the interest:

1. An absolute gift to Mrs. Martini with the hope that should we pass it on to the Christensens at some point.
2. A conditional fee to Martini to go to the Christensens when she no longer needs it
3. A life-estate with or without power to encroach and a gift over to the Christensens
4. A license of occupation for Martini and a gift over to the Christensens.

The court found that option 3 was most likely based on the reasonable interpretation of the words of the will. The question then turned to whether the life-estate came with a power to encroach. If it did, then there is a chance that the property would no longer exist by the time Mrs. Martini died. If that were the case, then Mr. Taylor's reference to "the property" would make no sense as there would be nothing left to give to the Christensens. Mr. Taylor clearly, therefore, expected the property to be left intact by Mrs. Martini (no power to encroach).

**Conclusion:** Mrs. Martini has a life estate with no power to encroach with a gift over to the Christensens. Appeal allowed.

# Aboriginal Title

There are many different forms of land titles under which indigenous individuals and nations own land. What makes a certain type of land title 'Aboriginal' is that it is some way peculiar to the particular history of Canada's first nations. In law, 'Aboriginal title' is a sui generis interest separate from common law land interests. Some nations do however hold common law interests in land that are codified by the 1982 Constitution Act.

## Background

**Doctrine of discovery:** This was a doctrine of international law under which the first "civilized" culture to discover an area of land would have sovereignty over it. At common law, this gave the Crown the radical title to discovered land and the right to govern it. Indigenous communities however, still had possessory rights to land which they occupied. The principle of occupation as proof of an interest in land is a standard common-law principle which undergirds concepts like adverse possession. This possessory right is the foundation for the modern concept of Aboriginal title.

**Terra nullius:** This legal concept gives the first person to step foot on unoccupied land the right to full title over it. As most British colonies were occupied prior to European arrival, this doctrine was seldom invoked in the 17th and 18th century. Later, in the 19th century, the Crown began to claim territories under *terra nullius.* British Columbia and Australia were claimed under this theory. This meant that existing communities had no legal rights to benefits from the land unless those rights were granted by the Crown. Australian and BC courts have since rejected this doctrine. The courts now have to deal with determining what legitimate rights first nations in BC have to their ancestral lands.

**Recognition of Aboriginal title:** Early colonial practices were premised on the fact that indigenous people had legal title to the land they occupied and controlled. Early settlers would purchase land from indigenous peoples which clearly indicates the belief that those indigenous people had legal title. The *Royal Proclamation 1763* set the standard for dealing with land rights in Canada after the conquest of New France. The RP stated that individual settlers and colonies would no longer be allowed to purchase land from indigenous peoples. Instead, the Crown had the sole right to purchase and enter into treaties for indigenous land. The RP itself justifies this policy on the grounds that it prevents exploitation. Current scholars point out the the policy granted a Crown monopsony which drove down the price of acquiring indigenous land. The RP is still in force to the extent it has not been repealed, which includes that Crown's right to purchase indigenous land. The RP also implicitly entrenched and recognized indigenous land rights.
The RP also forms the basis for the "honour of the Crown;" the government's fiduciary duty to indigenous peoples. 

**Evolution of Aboriginal title:** In order to form an agreement with the government of Canada, First Nations must logically have a pre-existing interest with which to trade for legal rights. Land cession treaties, such as treaty 6, recognized some form of Aboriginal title. This title can be used to ground an action against the government or other entities for infringement. The actual extent of rights granted by this title is obviously relevant in these actions. The Supreme Court in *St. Catherine's Milling v The Queen (1888)* held that Aboriginal title was a "personal and usurfructuary right." This ambiguous description obvious left the extent of rights granted by Aboriginal title open to interpretation. In *Calder (1973)* the court indicated the possibility that Aboriginal title continued to exist in BC were it had never been legally recognized under treaty. The *Constitution Act (1982) s.35* recognized Aboriginal rights as a constitutional concept. The *Calder* case was resolved by the *Nisga'a Final Agreement* under which the nisga'a people gave up Aboriginal title in return for self-government rights and fee simple title to certain lands to which they had Aboriginal title. This set a road map for resolving future claims:

+ A nation makes a claim to ancestral land
+ That claim is validated in the courts. This step is more difficult in BC where there are no pre-existing treaties to evidence prior land interests.
+ The Nation makes a "Final Agreement" which sets the legal rights of that nation to their ancestral land. 

## Delgamuukw v British Columbia

**Facts:** Gitxsan (G) and Wet'suwet'en (W) nations brought an action for the recognition of Aboriginal title in their ancestral lands in BC. Under G and W law, land was held by houses and clans. Thus, G and W pleadings asked for title to these houses and clans.

**Issue:** To what extent can Indigenous law be used to ground a common law action for Aboriginal land rights.

**Rule:** Aboriginal title is a mixture of common-law and indigenous law. The test for title is:

+ Occupation that is:
+ sufficient
+ exclusive
+ continuous

**Analysis:** The court dismissed the action as the pleadings could function under the common law understanding of Aboriginal title. At common law, Aboriginal title belongs to nations, not houses or clans. Indigenous law traditions inform the rights granted under the title but Indigenous law alone does not govern the title granting process. The court also offered very important obiter on how the title granting process would work and what rights it grants. Important points:

+ Aboriginal title is based on actual occupation of land prior to European sovereignty.
+ The operant point in time for occupation is when the Crown perfected its claim to the land in question (important where a nation moves or is moved).
+ Aboriginal title is owned by the nation as a whole.
+ Grants right to exclusive **use** and **occupation.**
+ Not a fee simple. The land is inalienable except to the Crown (cannot be directly sold to a private entity).
+ The use is also restricted to that which is not irreconciliable with the nature of the occupation and use of the land which forms the basis of the claim. For example, hunting land cannot be used for strip mining.
	+ This does not mean usage is limited to **only** the traditional use. Modern economic use is acceptable as long as it is not **irreconcilable.**

**Conclusion:** Action dismissed on procedural grounds.

## Haida Nation

**In brief:** Where there is an ongoing project on Crown land subject to unproven Aboriginal title claims, the government has a duty to consult. The government has to seriously consider the possibility that the aboriginal claim is valid. The courts have the authority to stop projects which did not properly consult even if there is no recognized aboriginal title.
