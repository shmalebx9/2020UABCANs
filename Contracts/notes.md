# LIVINGSTONE v. EVANS [1925] 3 W.W.R. 453, [1925] 4 D.L.R. 769 (Alta. S.C.)

----

The defendant, T.J. Evans, through his agent, wrote to the plaintiff offering to sell him the land in question for $1800 on terms. On the day that he received his offer the plaintiff wired this agent as follows: "Send lowest cash price. Will give $1600 cash. Wire.” The agent replied to this by telegram as follows ‘‘Cannot reduce price.” Immediately upon the receipt of this telegram the plaintiff wrote accepting the offer.

----

**Issue:**

Whether the plaintiff’s counter-offer was in law a rejection of the defendants’ offer which freed them from it

----

The price referred to in it was unquestionably that mentioned in his letter. His statement that he could not reduce that price strikes me as having but one meaning, namely, that he was still standing by it and, therefore, still open to accept it.

----

There will, therefore, be judgment for specific performance with
--
The offer was still active, tj gets the land at 1800

# BUTLER MACHINE TOOL CO. v. EX-CELL-O CORP.
[1979] 1 W.L.R. 401, [1979] 1 All E.R. 965 (C.A.)

----

quoted a price for a machine tool for £75,535, with delivery to be given in 10 months. On the back of their offer were a number of terms and conditions, which stipulated that they were to ‘‘prevail over any terms and conditions in the buyer’s order”. One of the conditions purported to allow the seller to charge the buyers the price for the machine prevailing at the time of delivery.

----

At the foot of the buyer’s order form, there was a tear-off slip upon which the sellers were invited to accept the order ‘‘on the terms and conditions stated thereon”. On 5th June 1969, the sellers completed and returned this slip to the buyers with a letter stating that the buyers’ order was being entered in accordance with the sellers’ quotation of 23rd May 1969.

----

The buyers rely on the acknowledgment signed by the sellers which accepted the buyers’ order ‘on the terms and conditions stated thereon’ (which did not include a price variation clause).

----

the quotation of 23rd May 1969 was an offer by the sellers to the buyers containing the terms and conditions on the back. The order of 27th May 1969 purported to be an acceptance of that offer in that it was for the same machine at the same price, but it contained such additions as to cost of installation, date of delivery and so forth, that it was in law a rejection of the offer and constituted a counter-offer.

----

in most cases when there is a ‘battle of forms’ there is a contract as soon as the last of the forms is sent and received without objection being taken to it.

----

I think the acknowledgment of 5th June 1969 is the decisive document. It makes it clear that the contract was on the buyers’ terms and not on the sellers’ terms: and the buyers’ terms did not include a price variation clause.
I would therefore allow the appeal and enter judgment for the buyers.

----

# TYWOOD INDUSTRIES LTD. v. ST. ANNE-NACKAWIC PULP & PAPER CO. LTD.

----

The plaintiff’s action is for the price of goods sold. The defendant has moved to stay the action under s. 7 of the Arbitrations Act, R.S.O. 1970, c. 25, upon the ground that the agreement of sale contained a clause for submission to arbitration. . . .

----

It appears to be common ground that neither the purchase order was signed by the plaintiff nor returned to the defendant. The goods were then delivered

----

the defendant (again perhaps not consciously) did try to impose the arbitration term in the purchase orders, but it drew no particular attention to that term

----

Defendant’s application for stay dismissed

----

# ProCD v. MATTHEW ZEIDENBERG AND SILKEN MOUNTAIN WEB SERVICES, INC. 86 F.3d 1447 (U.S. C.A. 7th Cir., 1996)

----

Must buyers of computer software obey the terms of shrinkwrap licenses? The district court held not . . . they are not contracts because the licenses are inside the box rather than printed on the outside.

----

Vendors prefer "end user license,” but we use the more common term: "Shrink wrap licence"

----

If because of high elasticity of demand in the consumer segment of the market the only way to make a profit turned out to be a price attractive to commercial users alone, then all consumers would lose out—and so would the commercial clients, who would have to pay more for the listings because ProCD could not obtain any contribution toward costs from the consumer market. **>**
Price discrimination serves consumer and commercial buyers

----

Matthew Zeidenberg bought a consumer package of SelectPhone (trademark) in 1994 from a retail outlet in Madison, Wisconsin, but decided to ignore the license. He formed Silken Mountain Web Services, Inc., to resell the information in the SelectPhone (trademark) database.

----

The court added that the second and third licenses stand no different from the first, even though they are identical, because they might have been different, and a purchaser does not agree to—and cannot be bound by—terms that were secret at the time of purchase. **>** Shrink wrap licences only known once the package is opened

----

but one of the terms to which Zeidenberg agreed by purchasing the software is that the transaction was subject to a license
--
The outside of the package states that there is a licence

----

acceptance of an offer differs from acceptance of goods after delivery

----

As we stressed above, adjusting terms in buyers’ favor might help Matthew Zeidenberg today (he already has the software) but would lead to a response, such as a higher price, that might make consumers as a whole worse off.

DAWSON v. HELICOPTER EXPLORATION CO.
[1955] S.C.R. 868, [1955] 5 D.L.R. 404

----

In 1931, Dawson had discovered and staked a mineral deposit in a remote area at the head of the Leduc River in British Columbia and a report of his discovery had been made to the B.C. Mines Department. He filed claims, which subsequently lapsed. In 1951, Dawson, who was then an officer in the U.S. Naval Reserve Engineering Corps and stationed in Utah, communicated several times with the respondent concerning the exploitation of this property

----

To this no reply was sent by Dawson. On August 1 an exploration party of the respondent investigated the Leduc River area and located showings reported in 1931 by Dawson. This did not become known to Dawson until some time in 1952. In 1953 the respondent made arrangements to enter upon the development of the claims by a new company to which the claims were sold in exchange for paid-up shares of the capital stock. Later on Dawson took legal advice and the action was launched on November 23, 1953
**>** After respondent said they were not interested in developing a mine on the land

----

RAND J. The substantial contention of the respondent is that any offer contained in the correspondence and in particular the letter of March 5 called for an acceptance not by promise but by the performance of an act, the location of the claims by Dawson for the respondent **>** They wanted Dawson to show them the land from helicopter as per the 1951 correspondence

----

I would, therefore, allow the appeal and remit the cause to the Supreme Court of British Columbia for the assessment of damages. The appellant will have his costs throughout.
--
Dawson won

----

## Concurring: ESTEY J.

----

Upon this record it rather appears that the respondent concluded it could continue without assistance from the appellant and, therefore, wrote the letter of repudiation.

----

the contract remained in force and binding upon both parties. It, therefore, remained the duty of the respondent, having obtained a pilot, to take the appellant into the area in August or September. Not only did the respondent not do so, but, notwithstanding the terms of its letter of repudiation, it, in fact, took Kvale and McQuillan into the area where they staked claims on behalf of the respondent. This conduct constituted a breach of its contract.

----

The appeal should be allowed with costs throughout and the matter referred back to the Supreme Court of British Columbia to determine the damages.

# FELTHOUSE v. BINDLEY (1862), 11 C.B. (N.S.) 869, 142 E.R. 1037 (Ex. Ch.)

----

The plaintiff, Paul Felthouse, had discussed with his nephew, John Felthouse, the purchase of a horse belonging to the nephew. However, owing to a misunderstanding, the uncle considered that he had purchased the horse for £30, whereas the nephew thought that the price was 30 guineas [a guinea was worth slightly more than £1].

----

To this letter the nephew sent no reply. On February 25th, an auction sale was held of the nephew’s farming stock. Bindley, the auctioneer, was instructed to reserve the horse in question from the sale, but he forgot to do so and the horse was sold for £33.

----

On these facts, the uncle brought an action against the auctioneer for the conversion of the horse

----

But, assuming that there had been a complete parol bargain before the 25th of February, and that the letter of the 27th was a mere expression of the terms of that prior bargain, and not a bargain then for the first time concluded, it would be directly contrary to the decision of the court of Exchequer in Stockdale v. Dunlop, [(1840), 151 E.R. 391], to hold that that acceptance had relation back to the previous offer so as to bind third persons in respect of a dealing with the property by them in the interim. . . .
[Byles and Keating JJ. concurred in making the rule absolute
**>**
Bindley not liable because an offer and acceptance cannot be retroactive. The horse was not sold to the uncle when bindley auctioned it off.

#SAINT JOHN TUG BOAT CO. v. IRVING REFINERY LTD.
[1964] S.C.R. 614, 49 M.P.R. 284, 46 D.L.R. (2d) 1

----

RITCHIE J. [delivering the judgment of the court] . . . Since early in 1960, the respondent has operated an oil refinery bordering on the harbour of Saint John, New Brunswick, at Courtenay Bay, and as a necessary incident of this operation it is supplied with crude oil brought by large tankers which are owned or chartered by the California Shipping Company, a corporation with its head office in the United States of America, which was, at all times material hereto, represented at Saint John by Kent Lines Limited, a shipping firm which was owned or controlled by the same interests as the respondent company.

----

The defendant had ample opportunity to notify the plaintiff that it did not accept any liability on that basis, but did not do so. The defendant acquiesced in the tug being so employed. It had and took the benefit of such stand by service and the probable avoidance of demurrage charges.
--
If the ships took too long to dock they would be charged, having a ship on standby helped avoid these charges

----

If, whatever a man’s real intention may be he so conducts himself that a reasonable man would believe that he was consenting to the terms proposed by the other party and that other party upon that belief enters into a contract with him, the man thus conducting himself would be equally bound as if he had intended to agree to the other party’s terms.
--
Legal test for conduct showing acceptance

----

In my view the respondent must be taken to have known that the Ocean Rockswift was being kept ‘‘standing by” for its use until the end of February 1962, and to have known also that the appellant expected to be paid for this special service at the per diem rate specified in the monthly invoices which were furnished to it, but the matter drifted from day to day without any move being made on the respondent’s behalf to either dispense with the service or complain about the charge.

----

The judgment of the trial judge was accordingly restored and damages of $79,639.00 were awarded, representing charges until February 28, 1962.]

ELIASON v. HENSHAW (1819), 4 Wheaton 225, 4 U.S. (L. Ed.) 556

----

This is an action, brought by the defendant in error [plaintiff in the court below and sellers], to recover damages for the non-performance of an agreement, alleged to have been entered into by the plaintiffs in error [defendants in the court below and alleged buyers], for the purchase of a quantity of flour at a stipulated price.

----

Capt. Conn informs us that you have a quantity of flour to dispose of. We are in the practice of purchasing flour at all times, in Georgetown, and will be glad to serve you, either in receiving your flour in store, when the markets are dull, and disposing of it when the markets will answer to advantage, or we will purchase at market price when delivered; if you are disposed to engage two or three hundred barrels at present, we will give you 9 dollars 50 cents per barrel, deliverable the first water in Georgetown, or any service we can. If you should want an advance, please write us by mail, and will send you part of the money in advance.
**>**
Letter from plaintiff to defendant

----

Your favour of the 10th inst. was handed me by Mr. Chenoweth last evening. I take the earliest opportunity to answer it by post. Your proposal to engage 300 barrels of flour, delivered in Georgetown, by the first water, at 9 dollars 50 cents per barrel, I accept, and shall send on the flour by the first boats that pass down from where my flour is stored on the river; as to any advance, will be unnecessary payment on delivery is all that is required.
**>**
Reply by defendant

----

The place, therefore, to which the answer was to be sent, constituted an essential part of the plaintiff’s offer

----

Their offer, it is true, was accepted by the terms of a letter addressed Georgetown, and received by the plaintiffs at that place; but an acceptance communicated at a place different from that pointed out by the plaintiffs, and forming a part of their proposal, imposed no obligation binding upon them, unless they had acquiesced in it, which they declined doing.

----

There was, therefore, no contract concluded between these parties.

## Communication of Acceptance

# HOUSEHOLD FIRE & CARRIAGE ACCIDENT INSURANCE CO. v. GRANT (1879), 4 Ex. D. 216 (C.A.)

**Facts:** Grant asked to buy shares in HFCAI and communicated with a representative of the company. Grant agreed on a price for the shares and was told he would receive a confirmation letter. His information was sent to the company who entered Grant in as a shareholder and sent the request for payment/official acceptance. Grant never received the letter (presumably lost by the postal service) and never paid. The company made dividend payments as per their shareholders records. The company went into insolvency and sued Grant for non-payment. Grant contends that he never received acceptance of his offer and is therefore not required to pay. At trial the plaintiff HFCAI won. The defendant appealed.

**Issue:** Whether a contract is enforceable when confirmation sent in the mail is not delivered without the acceptor's knowledge.

**Rule:** Acceptance sent via post is effected upon the postage of the acceptance, not the letter's reception.

**Analysis:** Generally, a contract is made when there is a meeting of the minds on terms. In this case, the conduct of the defendant and plaintiff showed a meeting of the minds and so it seems probable that a contract was made. The problem is that it seems impossible to say that an acceptance which "remains in the breast of the acceptor" can form the basis of a contract. The judge solves the dilemma by concluding that the post office should be considered the **agent** of both parties. Therefore, a rendering of acceptance to the post office amounts to a rendering to the plaintiff.

**Conclusion:** The two parties fully agreed to the terms of the contract and judgement is entered for HFCAI.

**Dissent:** BRAMWELL L.J. 

>Where a proposition to enter into a contract is made and accepted, it is necessary, as a rule, to constitute the contract that there should be a communication of that acceptance to the proposer.I ask whether any one who thinks not is prepared to follow that opinion to its consequence; suppose the offer is to sell a particular chattel, and the letter accepting it never arrives, is the property in the chattel transferred?

# HOLWELL SECURITIES LTD. v. HUGHES [1974] 1 W.L.R. 155, [1974] 1 All E.R. 161 (C.A.)

**Facts:** Hughes attempted to buy a piece of property (571 High Road) from the defendant Holwell Securities. Holwell stated that their offer could be accepted by "notice in writing to the Intending Vendor at any time within six months from the date hereof."  

**Issue:** Did the plaintiffs exercise an option to purchase the premises known as 571 High Road, Wembley, by posting a letter to the defendant which he never received?

**Rule:** Acceptance by postage as in Household Fire does not apply when

+ The agreement specifically requires recognition of acceptance
+ it would be absurd in the circumstances to accept it

**Analysis:** The judge stated two ways to the correct conclusion that the letter did not form a contract. First, the offer asked for **notice** which means recognition (to make known). Secondly, the general principle of contracts is that a contract cannot be one impossible to believe was intended. It is absurd to believe that in general, firms intend to sell land without knowledge of acceptance (as opposed to the HF case, where the contract could reasonably be made without the knowledge of acceptance).

**Conclusion:** Holwell wins, they did not sell the property.

## INSTANTANEOUS METHODS OF COMMUNICATION

# BRINKIBON LTD. v. STAHAG STAHL UND STAHLWARENHANDELSGESELLSCHAFT mbH [1983] 2 A.C. 34, [1982] 2 W.L.R. 264, [1982] 1 All E.R. 293 (H.L.)

**Facts:** The appellants (the buyers) desire to sue in this country the respondents (the sellers), an Austrian company, for breach of an alleged contract for the supply of steel. In order to do so, they must show that the contract was formed in England. The final contract was sent by the buyers via telex to Austria. 

**Rule:** The general rule is that a contract is formed when acceptance is communicated. If sent by post, the contract is formed when the message is posted.

**Analysis:** Once the message has been received on the offeror’s telex machine, it is not unreasonable to treat it as delivered to the principal offeror, because it is his responsibility to arrange for prompt handling of messages within his own office. A party (the acceptor) who tries to send a message by telex can generally tell if his message has not been received on the other party’s (the offeror’s) machine, whereas the offeror, of course, will not know if an unsuccessful attempt has been made to send an acceptance to him. It is therefore convenient that the acceptor, being in the better position, should have the responsibility of ensuring that his message is received. For these reasons the judge found that the general rule and not the postal rule should apply.

**Conclusion:** Contract formed in England.

# RUDDER v. MICROSOFT CORP. (1999), 2 C.P.R. (4th) 474, 40 C.P.C. (4th) 394 (Ont. S.C.J.)

**Facts:** The plaintiff's wish to sue Microsoft for undue charges related to the MSN service in Ontario. The member agreement which all MSN users must accept states that litigation must take place in Washington state. The plaintiff's hold that the member agreement is disanalagous to a paper contract and that since no one reads it, it is unenforceable. 

**Rule:** A court may disregard a jurisdictional agreement when the plaintiff makes a "strong case" that it is invalid. 

**Analysis:** The plaintiff's submit that the form in which the Member Agreement is provided to potential members of MSN is such that it obscures the forum selection clause. Therefore, the plaintiffs argue, the clause should be treated as if it were the fine print in a contract which must be brought specifically to the attention of the party accepting the terms. The agreement can however, be easily scrolled through. The scrolling feature is directly analagous to turning the page in a paper document, not fine print. Additionally, ruling in favour of the plaintiff's would make enforcing electronic contracts almost impossible.

**Conclusion:** It is plain and obvious that there is no factual foundation for the plaintiffs’ assertion that any term of the Membership Agreement was analogous to "fine print” in a written contract. The plaintiff's motion fails.

# Termination of Offer

This section deals with the conditions under which an offer has been validly revoked. Questions arise as to the legitimacy of a revocation when one party agrees to an offer after another party has decided that they no longer wish to contract.

# DICKINSON v. DODDS (1876), 2 Ch. D. 463 (C.A.)

**Facts:** Dodds agreed to sell Dickinson a farmhouse and land but later decided to sell to Allan. Dodds sued for specific performance to have to land sold to him as per the original offer.

+ June 10th: Dodds makes an offer to sell the land to Dickinson. In the offer he states that the offer remains open until the 9:00AM June 12th.
+ June 10th evening: Dickinson wrote an acceptance of the offer and tried to deliver it to Dodds at his home. Dodds was not there and the document was left with Dodds' mother-in-law. The document never reached Dodds.
+ June 11th: Dodds signed a formal contract to sell the property to Allan and received a deposit.
+ June 12th, Morning before 9:00AM: Berry (agent for Dickinson) located Dodds at the train station and handed him a letter of acceptance. Dodds informed Berry that it was too late and he had already sold the property.

**Issue:** Can an offer be revoked contrary to the terms of the offer itself?

**Rule:** There must be consideration (transfer) and meeting of the minds for a contract to be formed.

**Analysis:** The judge found that the 'open until 9' clause of the offer was not legally binding. There was no consideration between Dodds and Dickinson to make the offer itself a binding contract. The judge also found that the offer was validly revoked when Dickinson heard that the property was sold. Though Dickinson heard that the property was sold via a third person (not Dodds) it still makes a meeting of the minds impossible. Once Dodds knew the property was sold, he knew the offer was revoked and no acceptance of the original offer was possible. The judge also considered how the law deals with death of an offeror. When a person makes an offer and dies prior to its acceptance, the offer is considered void. Just as death prevents meeting of the minds, so too does knowledge of the impossibility of a contract.

**Conclusion:** Dodds' property was validly sold to Allan and Dickinson's claim was dismissed.

# BYRNE v. VAN TIENHOVEN (1880), 5 C.P.D. 344

**Facts:** Byrne is a new york company which sought to import plates for the defendant, Tienhoven in Cardiff. B claims to have made a valid contract and sues T for damages. B suffered as they had already made a contract in expectance of receiving the goods.

+ October 1st: T mails an offer to B for the sale of a thousand boxes of tin plates.
+ October 8th: Prior to the offer letter arriving in New York, T mailed a follow up letter revoking the offer.
+ October 11th: B received the initial offer and immediately sent a telegram **and** a letter accepting the offer.
+ B contracted to sell the plates to a third party once they arrived from Cardiff.
+ October 20th: The revocation letter arrives in New York, surprising B.

**Issue:** Whether a withdrawal of an offer has any effect until it is communicated to the person to whom the offer has been sent? 2. Whether posting a letter of withdrawal is a communication to the person to whom the letter is sent?

**Rule:** Position on a contract is established by conduct, not secret state of mind. Postal acceptance rule. **An offer can be revoked before it is accepted.**

**Analysis:** Question one is answered in the negative. A revocation is not in effect until the point at which it is known to both parties. If a state of mind is uncommunicated it is of no force in the law of contracts. The postal acceptance rule applies where it is implied that the post office is the agent of both parties. If a 'postal revocation' rule were to be made it would have to follow the same formulation. There is no evidence that in this case the parties intended on making the post office their mutual agent. The revocation is therefore of no effect. The acceptance of October 11th was valid and formed a contract between B and T. 

**Conclusion:** Tienhoven failed to fulfill a binding contract and is therefore liable for damages. A revocation must be communicated to have effect.

# ERRINGTON v. ERRINGTON AND WOODS [1952] 1 K.B. 290, [1952] 1 All E.R. 149 (C.A.)

**Facts:** clear. In 1930 the father bought the house for his son and daughter-in-law to live in. The father put down £250 in cash and borrowed £500 from a building society on the security of the house, repayable with interest by instalments of 15s. a week. He took the house in his own name and made himself responsible for the instalments. The father told the daughter-in-law that the £250 was a present for them, but he left them to pay the building society instalments of 15s. a week themselves. After the father's death, his estate attempted to take full ownership of the house. The son and daughter-in-law want to keep the house as it was promised to them by the father.

**Issue:** Can an offer be revoked by the death of the offeror if that death happens prior to the completion of the contract but after the offeree has begun fulfilling the requirements of the contract?

**Rule:** The death of the offeror voids acceptance of an offer.

**Analysis:** The father did die before the completion of the contract. The contract would be completed once all the payments had been made out by the son and his wife. The issue is complicated however, since the couple had already been making payments for years in expectance of the transfer of title. The father's promise formed a unilateral contract. The court found that once the couple began performing the duties of the contract, the father could not revoke the contract unless the couple stopped performing on their end. The court found that the couple were not technically purchasers but in effect they were as much. The couple was making payments on a house in return for title just as a purchaser makes payments on a house to the bank which transfers title at the conclusion of the payments. The couple should thus be treated in law the same as a normal home buyer.

**Conclusion:** Title should be transferred to the couple. The estate does not have claim on the house and cannot void the contract.

# BARRICK v. CLARK [1951] S.C.R. 177, [1950] 4 D.L.R. 529

**Facts:** Barrick represented the owners of land in Saskatchewan and sought to sell the land. Clark wanted to buy the land from Barrick.

+ October 30: Clark offers to purchase the land from Barrick for $14,500 and take possession between January and March.
+ November 15: Barrick made a counter offer of 15,000 and asked Clark to respond as soon as possible. Clark was on a hunting trip and so did not receive the letter.
+ November 20: Clark's wife received the letter and let Barrick know that her husband was away.
+ November 28: William Hohmann, not knowing of the offer to Clark, inquired about the land to Barrick.
+ November 30: Barrick offered the land to Hohmann for the same price.
+ December 3: Hohmann accepted Barrick's offer.
+ December 10: Clark accepted Barrick's offer upon return from his trip.

Clark sought a decree of specific performance of the alleged contract between himself and Barrick. His action was dismissed by the trial judge.
However, this judgment was reversed in the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal.

**Issue:** Was the offer made by Barrick voided by the the 20 days that elapsed before Clark accepted? Is 20 days a reasonable time to wait before accepting the offer?

**Rule:** An offer is considered open unless the offerror revokes prior to the offeree's acceptance. An offeree implicitly rejects an offer if they do not reply within a reasonable time.

**Analysis:** The judge assumed that the offer was received on November 20th. Clark's wife is assumed to be an agent of Clark. The judge also concluded that the time period in question was the time between Clark's wife's receipt of the letter and Clark's acceptance: 20 days. Though Barrick effectively voided the offer by contracting with Hohmann on December 3rd (13 days), Clark would have no cause to sue unless he accepted the offer. The judge then turned to explaining three reasons for which the 20 days could not be considered 'reasonable:'

+ Barrick used the word "immediately" in his offer, stressing a time concern.
+ Barrick asked Clark to respond "as soon as possible."
+ Barrick stated in the offer that a conveyance would be given on January 1st after completed payment. The date of January 1st is absurd if Barrick had intended for the process to commence on December 10th.

The judge thus concluded that an acceptance date of December 10th was not possibly in the mind of Barrick when the offer was made. Clark's delay was unreasonable. There could be no meeting of the minds in the contract since Barrick's view was clearly that the offer would be accepted prior to December 10th.

**Conclusion:** Appeal allowed. The supreme court held that the contract between Barrick and Hohmann was valid.

# Formation of Agreement: Certainty of terms

The theory that the existence of a contract is based upon the mutual acceptance of reciprocal obligations is premised on the assumption that it is possible to determine what those obligations are. Hence one of the requirements of a contract’s formation is that its terms define the parties’ obligations with certainty. The theme that underlies the body of law associated with the requirement of certainty is fundamentally the same as that underlying the principles of offer and acceptance. Both address the question of whether the parties are truly in agreement; that is, whether they share an unambiguous understanding of their respective rights and obligations. To express the point in more elegant and traditional terms, the question is whether the parties have achieved consensus ad idem. If the answer is no, the parties may have made an agreement, but it is not a contract.

Damages are awarded based on where the injured party would have been had the contract been carried out. Therefore, in order to grant a remedy, it must be possible to define precisely what it is that the party in breach was obliged to do under the contract.

The court tends to avoid declaring a contract void simply due to vagueness. In cases where a contract is ambiguous, the court tries to find a way to construe a contract. If a contract document was drawn up, then there is a reasonable implication that the words therein are meaningful.

# R. v. Cae Industries Ltd., [1986] 1 F.C. 129, [1985] 5 W.W.R. 481, 30 B.L.R. 236, 20 D.L.R. (4th) 347, 61 N.R. 19 (C.A.)

**Facts:** The Canadian government was phasing out use of an airfield in Winnipeg. The government sought to find a private sector buyer for the airfield to ensure the jobs of those working there. The government approached CAE industries (C) about taking over the airfield. In March 1969, a letter containing the following was sent to C:

>The Department of Defence Production can guarantee no more than 40,000 to 50,000 direct labour manhours per year in the period 1971 1976 as "set aside" repair and overhaul work, but the Government of Canada will employ its best efforts to secure the additional work required from other government departments and crown corporations to meet the target level of 700,000 direct labour manhours.

In 1971, the workload at the maintenance base diminished and the respondent sued for breach of contract. The appellant contends that in the circumstances the letter was never intended to become a binding legal contract.

**Issue:** Whether a contract which makes ambiguous promises about future duties is binding.

**Rule:** *ut res magis valeat quam pereat:* a deed shall never be void where the words may be applied to any extent to make it good.

**Analysis:** The court found that there must have been a contract of some form since it was partly carried out. For a time, the Canadian government did contribute the workforce hours specified. The terms were necessarily ambiguous. It would have been impossible for either party to forsee exactly what work would be needed and when. The thrust of the letter was simply to assure that work would be provided when needed. The letter therefore formed a binding contract. The contract requires the Canadian government to employ its best effort to provide up to 700,000 hours of labour.

**Conclusion:** Appeal dismissed.

# Incomplete terms

People often wish to establish mutually binding obligations to do something in the future although they are not able to articulate in advance the precise manner in which those obligations should be performed when the time arrives. The question is how to achieve an enforceable present commitment to a future performance that, at the time of the agreement, cannot be precisely defined. The cases comprising the trilogy all involved agreements for the sale of goods. In each case, the parties were unable at the time of their agreement to specify one or more such essential features of the anticipated transaction such as the price to be paid or the quality and exact description of the goods to be provided

# MAY & BUTCHER LTD. v. R. [1934] 2 K.B. 17 (H.L.)

**Facts:** The suppliants entered into an arrangement with the Disposals Board for the purchase of surplus "tentage", which remained in government hands following the end of the first world war. Correspondence from the Controller of the Disposals Board in June 1921 outlined the terms of these arrangements. The terms specified that the suppliants would buy all excess tentage and that arbitration would be done to clarify disagreements if they arose. The agreement originally lasted about a year but was extended thereafter by verbal agreement. A disagreement about price arose and the crown contended that they never agreed upon a price for the goods. The suppliants hold that the contract implicitly bind them to sell the goods at a reasonable price.

**Issue:** Is an ambiguous contract enforceable?

**Rule:** *ut res magis*

**Analysis:** The Crown says that the price was never agreed.
The suppliants say first, that if it was not agreed, it would be a reasonable price. Secondly, they say that even if the price was not agreed, the arbitration clause in the contract was intended to cover this very question of price, and that consequently the reasonableness of the price was referred to arbitration under the contract.
The court disagreed on the interpretation of the arbitration clause. Arbitration can only apply to valid contracts. Since the two parties, by failing to agree on price, failed to form the contract, the arbitration clause is ineffectual. The agreement in the letter was not a contract to buy and sell goods. Rather, it was a deposit to secure the performance of a later contract once it was completed. The later contract was never formed.

**Conclusion:** Appeal dismissed. The crown does not have to sell at a reasonable price to the appellants.

# HILLAS & CO. v. ARCOS LTD. (1932), 147 L.T. 503 (H.L.)

**Facts:** Across agreed to sell Hillas 100,000 standards of softwood in 1930. The contract for the sale included the following clause (s.9):

> Buyers [Hillas] shall also have the option of entering into a contract with the sellers for the purchase of 100,000 standards for delivery during 1931. Such contract to stipulate that, whatever the conditions are, buyers shall obtain the goods on conditions and at prices which show to them a reduction of 5 per cent on the f.o.b. value of the official price list at any time ruling during 1931. Such option to be declared before the 1st Jan. 1931

Hillas and Co. purported to exercise the option granted by clause 9, but Arcos claimed that the agreement had been cancelled and refused to deliver.

**Issue:** Whether the option provision reproduced above was a binding agreement for the purchase of timber during the 1931 season.

**Rule:** A contract should be interpreted according to the reasonable intentions of the parties.

**Analysis:** S.9 was interpreted as a contract to form a contract at a later date. The respondent (across) argued that even if it were a contract, the terms were too ambiguous to be enforceable. The court disagreed. The terms were stated in a way to protect an interest of the appellants. Namely, the agreement was that if Hillas agreed to buy now, they would be able to buy next year at a price 5% lower than what across would normally charge. The contract was meant to give Hillas an edge over its competitors. The appeals court had interpreted the case law in the respondent's favour. The case law cited held that contracts which specify that agreements are to be made in the future are not enforceable if those agreements are not made. The house of lords found that those rules did not apply in this case. The contract did not require specific later agreements like delivery times or quantities. Rather, the contract only specified that the appellants could buy, and at a reduced price. The contract is therefore not ambiguous.

**Conclusion:** Appeal allowed. Hillas is entitled to damages.

# Dalhousie College v Boutilier Estate, [1934] SCR 642

**Facts:** Boutilier agreed to donate on a regular basis to the college. Boutilier died and the College attempted to continue collecting his donations. The estate argued that the subscription agreement did not specify consideration and was therefore not a contract.

**Issue:** Does a donation subscription provide valid consideration?

**Rule:** In order for there to be a contract there must be consideration. Both sides must give something of value.

**Analysis:**The college argued that there was consideration because:

+ The subscription paper states that it was given in consideration of the subscription of others.
	+ Judge rejects because Boutilier did not contract with the others. The "others" are not parties to the contract. There is no **Privity of Contract.** Basically: the other donors giving money cannot be a condition because the college cannot bind them to do so. The college cannot legally say "if you pay, we will force these others to pay as well."
+ The statement about the purpose of the funds is a request for college to use the funds in that way.
	+ The promise is far too vague. There is no hypothetical situation in which Boutilier could rely on the "purpose statement" in an action against the college.
	+ There is no express request and agreement to do so.
	+ They would have done the "improvement of services" with or without Boutilier's donation.
+ The college spent a bunch of money in reliance on Boutilier's donation.
	+ Rejected based on a reductio. If this spending did bind boutillier, then a person can be bound by the later action of someone with whom they contracted. For example: Amy lets Don borrow her vacuum to "improve his house;" then Don agrees to give the vacuum to his cleaner every day; Amy would not be allowed to take the vacuum back.

**Conclusion:** There is no evidence of valid consideration. Appeal dismissed.

>"In the absence of some act or word which clearly indicated that he accompanied his subscription by a request to do something which the corporation would not have done except for his subscription, there is no such request as would justify a constructive consideration in support of this promise."

# Branford General Hospital Foundation v. Marquis Estate [2003] O.J. No. 6218 (Ont. S.C.J.)

**Facts:** Marquis gave lots of money to the hospital over the years. Her husband had worked for and given money to the hospital. The hospital's ICU was named after Mr. Marquis. Mrs. Marquis was very attached to the hospital because of her late husband. The hospital was undergoing a redesign and needed money for renovations. They approached Mrs. Marquis to become a major donor. Mrs. Marquis agreed to pay $200,000 a year for five years. The hospital agreed to name the new ICU after her and her late husband. Mrs. Marquis died before she could pay. The hospital sought to enforce the donation as a contract for the naming of the ICU.

**Analysis** Brantford argued there was consideration because:

+ Woodcock told Marquis that he would be willing to name the new unit after her if she donated. The hospital says this is the consideration for the money.
	+ Woodcock did not have the authority to make the name change without board approval > can't give what you don't have.
	+ Marquis never brought up the naming issue, only ever brought up by the hospital.
	+ Marquis was very modest and would not likely have cared about the name > militates in favour of it not being a factor in her decision.

# Wood v. Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon, 118 N.E. 214 (U.S. N.Y., 1917)

**Facts:** Gordon's fashion designs were popular and influential. Gordon sought Wood's services to market her designs. Gordon signed a deal under which Wood had the sole right to market her designs and Gordon would receive a share of the profits. Gordon later sold a design behind Wood's back. Wood sued for breach of contract. Gordon argued that there was no contract. Gordon submitted that the deal gave Wood exclusive rights but Gordon did not *necessarily* get anything in return, therefore no consideration.

**Issue:** Whether a deal which implies a benefit can be said to be valid. Whether the exclusivity deal has consideration.

**Rule:** Consideration is a benefit to one party at the expense of another.

**Analysis:** Very simply, the consideration was implied. Though Wood did not promise to actual market the designs, it is clear he was going to. The profits which would certainly (and did) result were valid consideration.

**Conclusion:** Appeal allowed. Gordon must pay wood for breach of contract.

# Lampleigh v Brathwait (1615), Hobart 105, 80 E.R. 255 (K.B.)

**Facts:** B murdered a third person. L offered to ride to London to petition the king for pardon. L made it to the king and pardon was given. When L returned, B agreed to pay 100 pounds in return for the journey. B later reneged on the deal. L sued to get the money back.

**Issue:** Whether a gift agreed to after a service can become a contract.

**Rule:** Gifts are not binding prior to actual delivery. Contracts cannot exist without consideration.

**Analysis:** It was clear that the 100 pounds was to be given in return for the journey and so it was not really a "gift." B was not bound when he made the promise for 100 pounds; rather he was bound earlier, when L agreed to make the journey. Payment for such a journey could be reasonably implied.

**Conclusion:** The consideration may come at a different time and may not be agreed on from the get-go but it is still effective.
